## [13] &quot;The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.  Their estate&quot;  
## [14] &quot;was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of&quot;   
## [15] &quot;their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so&quot;      
## [16] &quot;respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their&quot;    
## [17] &quot;surrounding acquaintance.  The late owner of this estate was a single&quot;  
## [18] &quot;man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his&quot;   
## [19] &quot;life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.  But her&quot; 
## [20] &quot;death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great&quot;       
## [21] &quot;alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received&quot;
## [22] &quot;into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal&quot;  
## [23] &quot;inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to&quot; 
## [24] &quot;bequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece, and their&quot;        
## [25] &quot;children, the old Gentleman&#39;s days were comfortably spent.  His&quot;        
## [26] &quot;attachment to them all increased.  The constant attention of Mr. and&quot;   
## [27] &quot;Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from&quot;     
## [28] &quot;interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid&quot;   
## [29] &quot;comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the&quot;       
## [30] &quot;children added a relish to his existence.&quot;                              
## [31] &quot;&quot;                                                                       
## [32] &quot;By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present&quot;   
## [33] &quot;lady, three daughters.  The son, a steady respectable young man, was&quot;   
## [34] &quot;amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,&quot; 
## [35] &quot;and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.  By his own&quot;    
## [36] &quot;marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his&quot;    
## [37] &quot;wealth.  To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not&quot; 
## [38] &quot;so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent&quot;  
## [39] &quot;of what might arise to them from their father&#39;s inheriting that&quot;        
## [40] &quot;property, could be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and their&quot;     
## [41] &quot;father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the&quot;         
## [42] &quot;remaining moiety of his first wife&#39;s fortune was also secured to her&quot;   
## [43] &quot;child, and he had only a life-interest in it.&quot;                          
## [44] &quot;&quot;                                                                       
## [45] &quot;The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other&quot; 
## [46] &quot;will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure.  He was neither so&quot;      
## [47] &quot;unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but&quot;
## [48] &quot;he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the&quot;     
## [49] &quot;bequest.  Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife&quot; 
## [50] &quot;and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to his son, and his&quot;    
## [51] &quot;son&#39;s son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as&quot;
## [52] &quot;to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear&quot; 
## [53] &quot;to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or&quot;
## [54] &quot;by any sale of its valuable woods.  The whole was tied up for the&quot;      
## [55] &quot;benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and&quot;   
## [56] &quot;mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by&quot;
## [57] &quot;such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three&quot;
## [58] &quot;years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his&quot;  
## [59] &quot;own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh&quot;
## [60] &quot;all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received&quot;</code></pre>

## 60          all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received
## 61        from his niece and her daughters.  He meant not to be unkind, however,
## 62           and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a
## 63                                                      thousand pounds a-piece.

## 65       Mr. Dashwood&#39;s disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was
## 66       cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years,
## 67        and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce
## 68                   of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate
## 69         improvement.  But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was
## 70           his only one twelvemonth.  He survived his uncle no longer; and ten
## 71       thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for
## 72                                                      his widow and daughters.
## 73                                                                              
## 74          His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.
## 75         Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness
## 76                 could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.
## 77                                                                              
## 78              Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the
## 79           family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at
## 80           such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make
## 81         them comfortable.  His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,
## 82       and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might
## 83                                     prudently be in his power to do for them.
## 84                                                                              
## 85        He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted
## 86        and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well
## 87        respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of
## 88           his ordinary duties.  Had he married a more amiable woman, he might
## 89        have been made still more respectable than he was:--he might even have
## 90         been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and
## 91        very fond of his wife.  But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature
## 92                                  of himself;--more narrow-minded and selfish.
## 93                                                                              
## 94        When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to
## 95             increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand
## 96             pounds a-piece.  He then really thought himself equal to it.  The
## 97          prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,
## 98            besides the remaining half of his own mother&#39;s fortune, warmed his
## 99         heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.-- &quot;Yes, he would give
## 100       them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would
## 101           be enough to make them completely easy.  Three thousand pounds! he
## 102           could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.&quot;-- He
## 103       thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did
## 104                                                                  not repent.
## 105                                                                             
## 106            No sooner was his father&#39;s funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,
## 107            without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,
## 108       arrived with her child and their attendants.  No one could dispute her
## 109            right to come; the house was her husband&#39;s from the moment of his
## 110          father&#39;s decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the
## 111       greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s situation, with only common
## 112       feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--but in HER mind there was
## 113      a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of
## 114            the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of
## 115       immovable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with
## 116        any of her husband&#39;s family; but she had had no opportunity, till the
## 117         present, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of
## 118                        other people she could act when occasion required it.
## 119                                                                             
## 120          So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so
## 121           earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the
## 122        arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had
## 123      not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the
## 124       propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children
## 125        determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach
## 126                                                          with their brother.
## 127                                                                             
## 128       Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed
## 129       a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified
## 130           her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and
## 131          enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,
## 132        that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led
## 133             to imprudence.  She had an excellent heart;--her disposition was
## 134       affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern
## 135        them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which
## 136                          one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.
## 137                                                                             
## 138        Marianne&#39;s abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor&#39;s.
## 139       She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her
## 140                  joys, could have no moderation.  She was generous, amiable,
## 141        interesting: she was everything but prudent.  The resemblance between
## 142                                     her and her mother was strikingly great.
## 143                                                                             
## 144        Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister&#39;s sensibility; but
## 145          by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished.  They encouraged each
## 146           other now in the violence of their affliction.  The agony of grief
## 147         which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought
## 148         for, was created again and again.  They gave themselves up wholly to
## 149      their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that
## 150          could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in
## 151              future.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could
## 152      struggle, she could exert herself.  She could consult with her brother,
## 153           could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with
## 154            proper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar
## 155                          exertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.
## 156                                                                             
## 157      Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but
## 158        as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne&#39;s romance, without
## 159        having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal
## 160                               her sisters at a more advanced period of life.
## 161                                                                             
## 162                                                                             
## 163                                                                             
## 164                                                                    CHAPTER 2
## 165                                                                             
## 166                                                                             
## 167        Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her
## 168        mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.
## 169       As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by
## 170           her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody
## 171          beyond himself, his wife, and their child.  He really pressed them,
## 172         with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no
## 173       plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she
## 174             could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his
## 175                                                     invitation was accepted.
## 176                                                                             
## 177             A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former
## 178      delight, was exactly what suited her mind.  In seasons of cheerfulness,
## 179         no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater
## 180            degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness
## 181        itself.  But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,
## 182           and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.
## 183                                                                             
## 184       Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended
## 185       to do for his sisters.  To take three thousand pounds from the fortune
## 186              of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most
## 187         dreadful degree.  She begged him to think again on the subject.  How
## 188      could he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too,
## 189        of so large a sum?  And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods,
## 190       who were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as no
## 191       relationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount.  It
## 192             was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist
## 193       between the children of any man by different marriages; and why was he
## 194         to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all his
## 195                                                   money to his half sisters?
## 196                                                                             
## 197        &quot;It was my father&#39;s last request to me,&quot; replied her husband, &quot;that I
## 198                                      should assist his widow and daughters.&quot;
## 199                                                                             
## 200       &quot;He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he
## 201           was light-headed at the time.  Had he been in his right senses, he
## 202      could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half
## 203                                           your fortune from your own child.&quot;
## 204                                                                             
## 205         &quot;He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only
## 206               requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their
## 207       situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do.  Perhaps it
## 208        would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.  He could
## 209       hardly suppose I should neglect them.  But as he required the promise,
## 210         I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time.
## 211         The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.  Something
## 212        must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new
## 213                                                                       home.&quot;
## 214                                                                             
## 215         &quot;Well, then, LET something be done for them; but THAT something need
## 216          not be three thousand pounds.  Consider,&quot; she added, &quot;that when the
## 217           money is once parted with, it never can return.  Your sisters will
## 218       marry, and it will be gone for ever.  If, indeed, it could be restored
## 219                                                    to our poor little boy--&quot;
## 220                                                                             
## 221          &quot;Why, to be sure,&quot; said her husband, very gravely, &quot;that would make
## 222          great difference.  The time may come when Harry will regret that so
## 223       large a sum was parted with.  If he should have a numerous family, for
## 224                           instance, it would be a very convenient addition.&quot;
## 225                                                                             
## 226                                                       &quot;To be sure it would.&quot;
## 227                                                                             
## 228          &quot;Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were
## 229              diminished one half.--Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious
## 230                                                 increase to their fortunes!&quot;
## 231                                                                             
## 232          &quot;Oh! beyond anything great!  What brother on earth would do half so
## 233        much for his sisters, even if REALLY his sisters!  And as it is--only
## 234                           half blood!--But you have such a generous spirit!&quot;
## 235                                                                             
## 236       &quot;I would not wish to do any thing mean,&quot; he replied.  &quot;One had rather,
## 237       on such occasions, do too much than too little.  No one, at least, can
## 238      think I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly
## 239                                                                expect more.&quot;
## 240                                                                             
## 241       &quot;There is no knowing what THEY may expect,&quot; said the lady, &quot;but we are
## 242            not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can
## 243                                                               afford to do.&quot;
## 244                                                                             
## 245        &quot;Certainly--and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds
## 246        a-piece.  As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have
## 247      about three thousand pounds on their mother&#39;s death--a very comfortable
## 248                                                fortune for any young woman.&quot;
## 249                                                                             
## 250          &quot;To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no
## 251         addition at all.  They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst
## 252        them.  If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do
## 253      not, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten
## 254                                                            thousand pounds.&quot;
## 255                                                                             
## 256          &quot;That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the
## 257       whole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother
## 258       while she lives, rather than for them--something of the annuity kind I
## 259      mean.--My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.
## 260                 A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.&quot;
## 261                                                                             
## 262          His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this
## 263                                                                        plan.
## 264                                                                             
## 265      &quot;To be sure,&quot; said she, &quot;it is better than parting with fifteen hundred
## 266       pounds at once.  But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years
## 267                                            we shall be completely taken in.&quot;
## 268                                                                             
## 269            &quot;Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that
## 270                                                                   purchase.&quot;
## 271                                                                             
## 272         &quot;Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when
## 273      there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy,
## 274      and hardly forty.  An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over
## 275         and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it.  You are not
## 276       aware of what you are doing.  I have known a great deal of the trouble
## 277         of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to
## 278        old superannuated servants by my father&#39;s will, and it is amazing how
## 279      disagreeable she found it.  Twice every year these annuities were to be
## 280         paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then
## 281        one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be
## 282      no such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.  Her income was not her
## 283         own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more
## 284           unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been
## 285      entirely at my mother&#39;s disposal, without any restriction whatever.  It
## 286         has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would
## 287                not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.&quot;
## 288                                                                             
## 289        &quot;It is certainly an unpleasant thing,&quot; replied Mr. Dashwood, &quot;to have
## 290         those kind of yearly drains on one&#39;s income.  One&#39;s fortune, as your
## 291        mother justly says, is NOT one&#39;s own.  To be tied down to the regular
## 292       payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it
## 293                                              takes away one&#39;s independence.&quot;
## 294                                                                             
## 295           &quot;Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.  They think
## 296       themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises
## 297        no gratitude at all.  If I were you, whatever I did should be done at
## 298       my own discretion entirely.  I would not bind myself to allow them any
## 299             thing yearly.  It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a
## 300                        hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.&quot;
## 301                                                                             
## 302       &quot;I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should
## 303        be no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will
## 304           be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they
## 305       would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger
## 306        income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the
## 307           year.  It will certainly be much the best way.  A present of fifty
## 308           pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for
## 309     money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father.&quot;
## 310                                                                             
## 311        &quot;To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within
## 312         myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at
## 313       all.  The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might
## 314       be reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a
## 315         comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,
## 316      and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they
## 317      are in season.  I&#39;ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,
## 318       it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.  Do but consider,
## 319         my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law
## 320         and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds,
## 321            besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which
## 322        brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will
## 323      pay their mother for their board out of it.  Altogether, they will have
## 324      five hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want
## 325        for more than that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will
## 326        be nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly
## 327         any servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of
## 328       any kind!  Only conceive how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a
## 329      year! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as
## 330      to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it.  They will
## 331                                    be much more able to give YOU something.&quot;
## 332                                                                             
## 333       &quot;Upon my word,&quot; said Mr. Dashwood, &quot;I believe you are perfectly right.
## 334        My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than
## 335       what you say.  I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil
## 336         my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you
## 337       have described.  When my mother removes into another house my services
## 338      shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can.  Some little
## 339                            present of furniture too may be acceptable then.&quot;
## 340                                                                             
## 341          &quot;Certainly,&quot; returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  &quot;But, however, ONE thing
## 342           must be considered.  When your father and mother moved to Norland,
## 343         though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and
## 344             linen was saved, and is now left to your mother.  Her house will
## 345           therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.&quot;
## 346                                                                             
## 347            &quot;That is a material consideration undoubtedly.  A valuable legacy
## 348            indeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant
## 349                                             addition to our own stock here.&quot;
## 350                                                                             
## 351            &quot;Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what
## 352        belongs to this house.  A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for
## 353          any place THEY can ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.
## 354      Your father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this: that you owe no
## 355        particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we very
## 356      well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything in the
## 357                                                              world to THEM.&quot;
## 358                                                                             
## 359       This argument was irresistible.  It gave to his intentions whatever of
## 360       decision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would be
## 361         absolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the
## 362      widow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts as
## 363                                                    his own wife pointed out.
## 364                                                                             
## 365                                                                             
## 366                                                                             
## 367                                                                    CHAPTER 3
## 368                                                                             
## 369                                                                             
## 370               Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any
## 371        disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased
## 372         to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when
## 373       her spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other
## 374               exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy
## 375         remembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her
## 376       inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for
## 377          to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.  But she could
## 378        hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and
## 379         ease, and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier
## 380        judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, which
## 381                                              her mother would have approved.
## 382                                                                             
## 383      Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on
## 384          the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last
## 385         earthly reflections.  She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no
## 386           more than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her
## 387             daughters&#39; sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was
## 388      persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her in
## 389           affluence.  For their brother&#39;s sake, too, for the sake of his own
## 390      heart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his
## 391       merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity.  His attentive
## 392        behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare
## 393              was dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on the
## 394                                                liberality of his intentions.
## 395                                                                             
## 396       The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for
## 397        her daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge
## 398      of her character, which half a year&#39;s residence in her family afforded;
## 399        and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal
## 400      affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found it
## 401              impossible to have lived together so long, had not a particular
## 402        circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according to
## 403     the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters&#39; continuance at Norland.
## 404                                                                             
## 405       This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and
## 406       the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing young
## 407        man, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister&#39;s
## 408       establishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of
## 409                                                              his time there.
## 410                                                                             
## 411              Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of
## 412        interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died
## 413        very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,
## 414         for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on the
## 415      will of his mother.  But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either
## 416        consideration.  It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,
## 417         that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.
## 418         It was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune
## 419          should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of
## 420           disposition; and that Elinor&#39;s merit should not be acknowledged by
## 421                 every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.
## 422                                                                             
## 423              Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any
## 424          peculiar graces of person or address.  He was not handsome, and his
## 425       manners required intimacy to make them pleasing.  He was too diffident
## 426         to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,
## 427          his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.
## 428             His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid
## 429      improvement.  But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to
## 430            answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him
## 431         distinguished--as--they hardly knew what.  They wanted him to make a
## 432      fine figure in the world in some manner or other.  His mother wished to
## 433        interest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to
## 434          see him connected with some of the great men of the day.  Mrs. John
## 435        Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these
## 436              superior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her
## 437          ambition to see him driving a barouche.  But Edward had no turn for
## 438         great men or barouches.  All his wishes centered in domestic comfort
## 439         and the quiet of private life.  Fortunately he had a younger brother
## 440                                                      who was more promising.
## 441                                                                             
## 442         Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged
## 443        much of Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s attention; for she was, at that time, in such
## 444         affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects.  She saw
## 445        only that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.  He
## 446      did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation.
## 447                She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by a
## 448            reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference
## 449         between him and his sister.  It was a contrast which recommended him
## 450                                                 most forcibly to her mother.
## 451                                                                             
## 452         &quot;It is enough,&quot; said she; &quot;to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough.
## 453                         It implies everything amiable.  I love him already.&quot;
## 454                                                                             
## 455       &quot;I think you will like him,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;when you know more of him.&quot;
## 456                                                                             
## 457        &quot;Like him!&quot; replied her mother with a smile.  &quot;I feel no sentiment of
## 458                                               approbation inferior to love.&quot;
## 459                                                                             
## 460                                                        &quot;You may esteem him.&quot;
## 461                                                                             
## 462            &quot;I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love.&quot;
## 463                                                                             
## 464        Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him.  Her manners
## 465                 were attaching, and soon banished his reserve.  She speedily
## 466         comprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor
## 467         perhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of his
## 468        worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all
## 469      her established ideas of what a young man&#39;s address ought to be, was no
## 470       longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper
## 471                                                                affectionate.
## 472                                                                             
## 473           No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to
## 474         Elinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and
## 475                     looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.
## 476                                                                             
## 477          &quot;In a few months, my dear Marianne.&quot; said she, &quot;Elinor will, in all
## 478         probability be settled for life.  We shall miss her; but SHE will be
## 479                                                                      happy.&quot;
## 480                                                                             
## 481                                     &quot;Oh! Mama, how shall we do without her?&quot;
## 482                                                                             
## 483      &quot;My love, it will be scarcely a separation.  We shall live within a few
## 484        miles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives.  You will
## 485            gain a brother, a real, affectionate brother.  I have the highest
## 486       opinion in the world of Edward&#39;s heart.  But you look grave, Marianne;
## 487                                     do you disapprove your sister&#39;s choice?&quot;
## 488                                                                             
## 489             &quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Marianne, &quot;I may consider it with some surprise.
## 490         Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly.  But yet--he is not
## 491         the kind of young man--there is something wanting--his figure is not
## 492         striking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man
## 493        who could seriously attach my sister.  His eyes want all that spirit,
## 494      that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence.  And besides
## 495              all this, I am afraid, Mama, he has no real taste.  Music seems
## 496        scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor&#39;s drawings very
## 497          much, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their
## 498       worth.  It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her while
## 499       she draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matter.  He admires as
## 500      a lover, not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters must be
## 501        united.  I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every
## 502         point coincide with my own.  He must enter into all my feelings; the
## 503                same books, the same music must charm us both.  Oh! mama, how
## 504        spiritless, how tame was Edward&#39;s manner in reading to us last night!
## 505            I felt for my sister most severely.  Yet she bore it with so much
## 506         composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.  I could hardly keep my
## 507            seat.  To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost
## 508             driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such
## 509                                                      dreadful indifference!&quot;
## 510                                                                             
## 511      &quot;He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose.
## 512                    I thought so at the time; but you WOULD give him Cowper.&quot;
## 513                                                                             
## 514        &quot;Nay, Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--but we must allow
## 515      for difference of taste.  Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she
## 516          may overlook it, and be happy with him.  But it would have broke MY
## 517         heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.
## 518           Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I
## 519        shall never see a man whom I can really love.  I require so much!  He
## 520              must have all Edward&#39;s virtues, and his person and manners must
## 521                            ornament his goodness with every possible charm.&quot;
## 522                                                                             
## 523      &quot;Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.  It is yet too early in
## 524       life to despair of such a happiness.  Why should you be less fortunate
## 525           than your mother?  In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your
## 526                                             destiny be different from hers!&quot;
## 527                                                                             
## 528                                                                             
## 529                                                                             
## 530                                                                    CHAPTER 4
## 531                                                                             
## 532                                                                             
## 533      &quot;What a pity it is, Elinor,&quot; said Marianne, &quot;that Edward should have no
## 534                                                          taste for drawing.&quot;
## 535                                                                             
## 536         &quot;No taste for drawing!&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;why should you think so? He
## 537       does not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the
## 538             performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means
## 539           deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of
## 540           improving it.  Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he
## 541           would have drawn very well.  He distrusts his own judgment in such
## 542      matters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any
## 543       picture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which
## 544                                      in general direct him perfectly right.&quot;
## 545                                                                             
## 546       Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but
## 547      the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by the
## 548          drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight,
## 549             which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste.  Yet, though
## 550      smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister for that
## 551                                blind partiality to Edward which produced it.
## 552                                                                             
## 553            &quot;I hope, Marianne,&quot; continued Elinor, &quot;you do not consider him as
## 554      deficient in general taste.  Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,
## 555        for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your
## 556                         opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him.&quot;
## 557                                                                             
## 558       Marianne hardly knew what to say.  She would not wound the feelings of
## 559       her sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe was
## 560                                          impossible.  At length she replied:
## 561                                                                             
## 562       &quot;Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thing
## 563                   equal to your sense of his merits.  I have not had so many
## 564        opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his
## 565      inclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion in
## 566        the world of his goodness and sense.  I think him every thing that is
## 567                                                         worthy and amiable.&quot;
## 568                                                                             
## 569         &quot;I am sure,&quot; replied Elinor, with a smile, &quot;that his dearest friends
## 570          could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that.  I do not
## 571                        perceive how you could express yourself more warmly.&quot;
## 572                                                                             
## 573                  Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.
## 574                                                                             
## 575            &quot;Of his sense and his goodness,&quot; continued Elinor, &quot;no one can, I
## 576           think, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in
## 577        unreserved conversation.  The excellence of his understanding and his
## 578       principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps
## 579        him silent.  You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.
## 580              But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from
## 581        peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself.  He and I
## 582          have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been
## 583         wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother.  I
## 584         have seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard
## 585      his opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I
## 586      venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books
## 587          exceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just and
## 588            correct, and his taste delicate and pure.  His abilities in every
## 589         respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.
## 590        At first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person
## 591        can hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which
## 592        are uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is
## 593          perceived.  At present, I know him so well, that I think him really
## 594                  handsome; or at least, almost so.  What say you, Marianne?&quot;
## 595                                                                             
## 596        &quot;I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now.  When
## 597       you tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection
## 598                                    in his face, than I now do in his heart.&quot;
## 599                                                                             
## 600         Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she
## 601      had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.  She felt that Edward stood
## 602         very high in her opinion.  She believed the regard to be mutual; but
## 603        she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne&#39;s conviction of
## 604      their attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that what Marianne and her
## 605       mother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them,
## 606        to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect.  She tried to explain
## 607                                    the real state of the case to her sister.
## 608                                                                             
## 609           &quot;I do not attempt to deny,&quot; said she, &quot;that I think very highly of
## 610                                him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.&quot;
## 611                                                                             
## 612                                 Marianne here burst forth with indignation--
## 613                                                                             
## 614                  &quot;Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh!  worse than
## 615      cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.  Use those words again, and I
## 616                                            will leave the room this moment.&quot;
## 617                                                                             
## 618      Elinor could not help laughing.  &quot;Excuse me,&quot; said she; &quot;and be assured
## 619        that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my
## 620             own feelings.  Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;
## 621      believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion--the
## 622       hope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly.
## 623        But farther than this you must not believe.  I am by no means assured
## 624         of his regard for me.  There are moments when the extent of it seems
## 625      doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at
## 626               my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by
## 627                 believing or calling it more than it is.  In my heart I feel
## 628           little--scarcely any doubt of his preference.  But there are other
## 629        points to be considered besides his inclination.  He is very far from
## 630      being independent.  What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from
## 631        Fanny&#39;s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never
## 632           been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if
## 633         Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in
## 634      his way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great
## 635                                                       fortune or high rank.&quot;
## 636                                                                             
## 637       Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother
## 638                                       and herself had outstripped the truth.
## 639                                                                             
## 640        &quot;And you really are not engaged to him!&quot; said she.  &quot;Yet it certainly
## 641       soon will happen.  But two advantages will proceed from this delay.  I
## 642      shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity of
## 643        improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be
## 644        so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.  Oh! if he should
## 645         be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, how
## 646                                                     delightful it would be!&quot;
## 647                                                                             
## 648              Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister.  She could not
## 649      consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne
## 650           had believed it.  There was, at times, a want of spirits about him
## 651       which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as
## 652      unpromising.  A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not
## 653       give him more than inquietude.  It would not be likely to produce that
## 654          dejection of mind which frequently attended him.  A more reasonable
## 655            cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the
## 656       indulgence of his affection.  She knew that his mother neither behaved
## 657        to him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give him
## 658        any assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictly
## 659        attending to her views for his aggrandizement.  With such a knowledge
## 660      as this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.  She
## 661        was far from depending on that result of his preference of her, which
## 662          her mother and sister still considered as certain.  Nay, the longer
## 663        they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard;
## 664      and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more
## 665                                                             than friendship.
## 666                                                                             
## 667      But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived
## 668          by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, (which was
## 669                 still more common,) to make her uncivil.  She took the first
## 670      opportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to
## 671             her so expressively of her brother&#39;s great expectations, of Mrs.
## 672        Ferrars&#39;s resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the
## 673          danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that
## 674       Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to
## 675              be calm.  She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and
## 676               instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the
## 677          inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor
## 678                     should not be exposed another week to such insinuations.
## 679                                                                             
## 680         In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the
## 681        post, which contained a proposal particularly well timed.  It was the
## 682       offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of
## 683         her own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.  The
## 684       letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit
## 685          of friendly accommodation.  He understood that she was in need of a
## 686      dwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,
## 687          he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might
## 688         think necessary, if the situation pleased her.  He earnestly pressed
## 689      her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come with
## 690           her daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from
## 691      whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houses
## 692       were in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable
## 693       to her.  He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of
## 694           his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of
## 695      giving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was
## 696               suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer
## 697           connections.  She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry.  Her
## 698            resolution was formed as she read.  The situation of Barton, in a
## 699      county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours
## 700             before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every
## 701                 possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first
## 702       recommendation.  To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an
## 703        evil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison of
## 704      the misery of continuing her daughter-in-law&#39;s guest; and to remove for
## 705        ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or
## 706       visit it while such a woman was its mistress.  She instantly wrote Sir
## 707        John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance
## 708               of his proposal; and then hastened to shew both letters to her
## 709          daughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before her
## 710                                                            answer were sent.
## 711                                                                             
## 712        Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle
## 713        at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present
## 714         acquaintance.  On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose
## 715      her mother&#39;s intention of removing into Devonshire.  The house, too, as
## 716             described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so
## 717         uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either
## 718      point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charm
## 719           to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland
## 720           beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from
## 721                                            sending a letter of acquiescence.
## 722                                                                             
## 723                                                                             
## 724                                                                             
## 725                                                                    CHAPTER 5
## 726                                                                             
## 727                                                                             
## 728     No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself
## 729        in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that she
## 730     was provided with a house, and should incommode them no longer than till
## 731            every thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They heard her with
## 732     surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly hoped
## 733                that she would not be settled far from Norland. She had great
## 734         satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.--Edward
## 735     turned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise
## 736                 and concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated,
## 737         &quot;Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And to
## 738      what part of it?&quot; She explained the situation. It was within four miles
## 739                                                         northward of Exeter.
## 740                                                                             
## 741          &quot;It is but a cottage,&quot; she continued, &quot;but I hope to see many of my
## 742         friends in it.  A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends
## 743          find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will
## 744                                            find none in accommodating them.&quot;
## 745                                                                             
## 746      She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood
## 747        to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still greater
## 748        affection.  Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had
## 749                  made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was
## 750          unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that
## 751         point to which it principally tended.  To separate Edward and Elinor
## 752        was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs.
## 753        John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally
## 754                             she disregarded her disapprobation of the match.
## 755                                                                             
## 756      Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry
## 757      he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to
## 758       prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture.  He
## 759              really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very
## 760       exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his
## 761       father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture
## 762      was all sent around by water.  It chiefly consisted of household linen,
## 763           plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne&#39;s.
## 764        Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could not
## 765              help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s income would be so
## 766          trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any handsome
## 767                                                        article of furniture.
## 768                                                                             
## 769      Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished,
## 770      and she might have immediate possession.  No difficulty arose on either
## 771           side in the agreement; and she waited only for the disposal of her
## 772        effects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before she
## 773          set off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid in the
## 774           performance of everything that interested her, was soon done.--The
## 775       horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his
## 776         death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage,
## 777         she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest
## 778       daughter.  For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her
## 779             own wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor
## 780           prevailed.  HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to
## 781       three; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided from
## 782                 amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.
## 783                                                                             
## 784      The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire,
## 785               to prepare the house for their mistress&#39;s arrival; for as Lady
## 786         Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going
## 787           directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she
## 788         relied so undoubtingly on Sir John&#39;s description of the house, as to
## 789      feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own.
## 790       Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by
## 791       the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her
## 792       removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed
## 793          under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.  Now was the
## 794       time when her son-in-law&#39;s promise to his father might with particular
## 795            propriety be fulfilled.  Since he had neglected to do it on first
## 796         coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on as
## 797          the most suitable period for its accomplishment.  But Mrs. Dashwood
## 798      began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced,
## 799        from the general drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended
## 800          no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.  He so
## 801         frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and of
## 802      the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence in
## 803        the world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to
## 804        stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving
## 805                                                                  money away.
## 806                                                                             
## 807          In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton&#39;s
## 808      first letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their future
## 809            abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their
## 810                                                                     journey.
## 811                                                                             
## 812          Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so
## 813          much beloved.  &quot;Dear, dear Norland!&quot; said Marianne, as she wandered
## 814      alone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; &quot;when
## 815      shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh!
## 816       happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this
## 817               spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you, ye
## 818       well-known trees!--but you will continue the same.--No leaf will decay
## 819         because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we
## 820      can observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same; unconscious
## 821            of the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of any
## 822           change in those who walk under your shade!--But who will remain to
## 823                                                                  enjoy you?&quot;
## 824                                                                             
## 825                                                                             
## 826                                                                             
## 827                                                                    CHAPTER 6
## 828                                                                             
## 829                                                                             
## 830            The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a
## 831        disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant.  But as they
## 832            drew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a
## 833      country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view
## 834        of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.  It was a
## 835      pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture.  After winding
## 836        along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house.  A small
## 837         green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket
## 838                                                  gate admitted them into it.
## 839                                                                             
## 840       As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;
## 841         but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the
## 842         roof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were
## 843          the walls covered with honeysuckles.  A narrow passage led directly
## 844      through the house into the garden behind.  On each side of the entrance
## 845      was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were the
## 846      offices and the stairs.  Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest
## 847      of the house.  It had not been built many years and was in good repair.
## 848       In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but the tears
## 849          which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon
## 850           dried away.  They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their
## 851       arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.
## 852          It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from first
## 853       seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received an
## 854       impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending
## 855                                             it to their lasting approbation.
## 856                                                                             
## 857            The situation of the house was good.  High hills rose immediately
## 858       behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open
## 859           downs, the others cultivated and woody.  The village of Barton was
## 860           chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the
## 861               cottage windows.  The prospect in front was more extensive; it
## 862      commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.
## 863         The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that
## 864        direction; under another name, and in another course, it branched out
## 865                                   again between two of the steepest of them.
## 866                                                                             
## 867          With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the
## 868      whole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered many
## 869          additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was a
## 870        delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply
## 871      all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.  &quot;As for the
## 872        house itself, to be sure,&quot; said she, &quot;it is too small for our family,
## 873      but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as it
## 874       is too late in the year for improvements.  Perhaps in the spring, if I
## 875              have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think about
## 876          building.  These parlors are both too small for such parties of our
## 877      friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts
## 878          of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the
## 879       other, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this,
## 880         with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamber
## 881          and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage.  I could
## 882         wish the stairs were handsome.  But one must not expect every thing;
## 883           though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them.  I
## 884        shall see how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring, and
## 885                                  we will plan our improvements accordingly.&quot;
## 886                                                                             
## 887          In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the
## 888       savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never saved
## 889      in her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it
## 890       was; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns,
## 891      and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, to
## 892              form themselves a home.  Marianne&#39;s pianoforte was unpacked and
## 893        properly disposed of; and Elinor&#39;s drawings were affixed to the walls
## 894                                                       of their sitting room.
## 895                                                                             
## 896      In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast
## 897        the next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcome
## 898           them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his own
## 899         house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.  Sir
## 900          John Middleton was a good looking man about forty.  He had formerly
## 901            visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young cousins to
## 902         remember him.  His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured; and his
## 903          manners were as friendly as the style of his letter.  Their arrival
## 904           seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to be an
## 905        object of real solicitude to him.  He said much of his earnest desire
## 906      of their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressed
## 907            them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were
## 908        better settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried to a
## 909          point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence.
## 910          His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after he
## 911        left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from
## 912       the park, which was followed before the end of the day by a present of
## 913          game.  He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their letters to and
## 914          from the post for them, and would not be denied the satisfaction of
## 915                                        sending them his newspaper every day.
## 916                                                                             
## 917            Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting her
## 918        intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assured
## 919            that her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message was
## 920        answered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introduced
## 921                                                        to them the next day.
## 922                                                                             
## 923        They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of
## 924      their comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her appearance
## 925        was favourable to their wishes.  Lady Middleton was not more than six
## 926              or seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall and
## 927        striking, and her address graceful.  Her manners had all the elegance
## 928       which her husband&#39;s wanted.  But they would have been improved by some
## 929          share of his frankness and warmth; and her visit was long enough to
## 930       detract something from their first admiration, by shewing that, though
## 931      perfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for
## 932                      herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.
## 933                                                                             
## 934       Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and
## 935      Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their
## 936          eldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which means
## 937      there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of
## 938      extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty,
## 939       and ask him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hung
## 940               about her and held down his head, to the great surprise of her
## 941       ladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he could
## 942        make noise enough at home.  On every formal visit a child ought to be
## 943        of the party, by way of provision for discourse.  In the present case
## 944       it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his
## 945         father or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of
## 946             course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the
## 947                                                       opinion of the others.
## 948                                                                             
## 949      An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the
## 950          rest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house without
## 951                   securing their promise of dining at the park the next day.
## 952                                                                             
## 953                                                                             
## 954                                                                             
## 955                                                                    CHAPTER 7
## 956                                                                             
## 957                                                                             
## 958          Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.  The ladies had
## 959       passed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from
## 960         their view at home by the projection of a hill.  The house was large
## 961       and handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality
## 962       and elegance.  The former was for Sir John&#39;s gratification, the latter
## 963          for that of his lady.  They were scarcely ever without some friends
## 964          staying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every
## 965        kind than any other family in the neighbourhood.  It was necessary to
## 966          the happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward
## 967          behaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of
## 968          talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with
## 969      such as society produced, within a very narrow compass.  Sir John was a
## 970             sportsman, Lady Middleton a mother.  He hunted and shot, and she
## 971            humoured her children; and these were their only resources.  Lady
## 972      Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the
## 973       year round, while Sir John&#39;s independent employments were in existence
## 974      only half the time.  Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,
## 975         supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported the
## 976      good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of his
## 977                                                                        wife.
## 978                                                                             
## 979         Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of
## 980          all her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her
## 981                  greatest enjoyment in any of their parties.  But Sir John&#39;s
## 982       satisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting
## 983       about him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier
## 984           they were the better was he pleased.  He was a blessing to all the
## 985            juvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever
## 986      forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter
## 987        his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not
## 988                          suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.
## 989                                                                             
## 990        The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy
## 991       to him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants
## 992      he had now procured for his cottage at Barton.  The Miss Dashwoods were
## 993             young, pretty, and unaffected.  It was enough to secure his good
## 994       opinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to
## 995         make her mind as captivating as her person.  The friendliness of his
## 996           disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation
## 997        might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate.  In
## 998       showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction
## 999             of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his
## 1000       cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman,
## 1001      though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is
## 1002        not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a
## 1003                                             residence within his own manor.
## 1004                                                                            
## 1005        Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by
## 1006       Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity;
## 1007           and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young
## 1008        ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day
## 1009      before, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.  They
## 1010             would see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a
## 1011     particular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither very
## 1012        young nor very gay.  He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of
## 1013       the party, and could assure them it should never happen so again.  He
## 1014        had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some
## 1015      addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was full
## 1016      of engagements.  Luckily Lady Middleton&#39;s mother had arrived at Barton
## 1017       within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman,
## 1018      he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might
## 1019         imagine.  The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectly
## 1020     satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for
## 1021                                                                    no more.
## 1022                                                                            
## 1023         Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton&#39;s mother, was a good-humoured, merry,
## 1024         fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and
## 1025       rather vulgar.  She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner
## 1026            was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and
## 1027       husbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,
## 1028      and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.  Marianne was
## 1029       vexed at it for her sister&#39;s sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinor
## 1030           to see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave
## 1031       Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery
## 1032                                                         as Mrs. Jennings&#39;s.
## 1033                                                                            
## 1034          Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by
## 1035       resemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be
## 1036           his wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton&#39;s mother.  He was
## 1037      silent and grave.  His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite
## 1038        of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old
## 1039       bachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though
## 1040            his face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and his
## 1041                                     address was particularly gentlemanlike.
## 1042                                                                            
## 1043         There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as
## 1044      companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton
## 1045      was so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity of
## 1046          Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his
## 1047       mother-in-law was interesting.  Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to
## 1048     enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner,
## 1049     who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of
## 1050                                discourse except what related to themselves.
## 1051                                                                            
## 1052           In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was
## 1053       invited to play.  The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to
## 1054         be charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went
## 1055        through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into
## 1056        the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in
## 1057        the same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebrated
## 1058        that event by giving up music, although by her mother&#39;s account, she
## 1059              had played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.
## 1060                                                                            
## 1061      Marianne&#39;s performance was highly applauded.  Sir John was loud in his
## 1062        admiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation
## 1063         with the others while every song lasted.  Lady Middleton frequently
## 1064     called him to order, wondered how any one&#39;s attention could be diverted
## 1065       from music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song
## 1066        which Marianne had just finished.  Colonel Brandon alone, of all the
## 1067           party, heard her without being in raptures.  He paid her only the
## 1068              compliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on the
## 1069      occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless
## 1070       want of taste.  His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that
## 1071             ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, was
## 1072         estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the
## 1073       others; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and
## 1074          thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every
## 1075     exquisite power of enjoyment.  She was perfectly disposed to make every
## 1076           allowance for the colonel&#39;s advanced state of life which humanity
## 1077                                                                   required.
## 1078                                                                            
## 1079                                                                            
## 1080                                                                            
## 1081                                                                   CHAPTER 8
## 1082                                                                            
## 1083                                                                            
## 1084         Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.  She had only two
## 1085       daughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, and
## 1086        she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the
## 1087        world.  In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, as
## 1088         far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projecting
## 1089           weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance.  She was
## 1090       remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the
## 1091     advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by
## 1092           insinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind of
## 1093      discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to
## 1094          pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne
## 1095      Dashwood.  She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first evening
## 1096        of their being together, from his listening so attentively while she
## 1097     sang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons&#39; dining
## 1098     at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.
## 1099          It must be so.  She was perfectly convinced of it.  It would be an
## 1100      excellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE was handsome.  Mrs. Jennings
## 1101        had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her
## 1102        connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge; and she
## 1103             was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl.
## 1104                                                                            
## 1105      The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, for
## 1106      it supplied her with endless jokes against them both.  At the park she
## 1107      laughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne.  To the former
## 1108              her raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,
## 1109                    perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at first
## 1110       incomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knew
## 1111        whether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,
## 1112           for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel&#39;s
## 1113            advanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.
## 1114                                                                            
## 1115            Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than
## 1116     herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of
## 1117       her daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability of
## 1118                                       wishing to throw ridicule on his age.
## 1119                                                                            
## 1120       &quot;But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,
## 1121     though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured.  Colonel Brandon
## 1122      is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MY
## 1123        father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must have
## 1124     long outlived every sensation of the kind.  It is too ridiculous!  When
## 1125            is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not
## 1126                                                               protect him?&quot;
## 1127                                                                            
## 1128       &quot;Infirmity!&quot; said Elinor, &quot;do you call Colonel Brandon infirm?  I can
## 1129       easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my
## 1130     mother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of
## 1131                                                                 his limbs!&quot;
## 1132                                                                            
## 1133      &quot;Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?  and is not that the
## 1134                                     commonest infirmity of declining life?&quot;
## 1135                                                                            
## 1136       &quot;My dearest child,&quot; said her mother, laughing, &quot;at this rate you must
## 1137       be in continual terror of MY decay; and it must seem to you a miracle
## 1138               that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty.&quot;
## 1139                                                                            
## 1140         &quot;Mama, you are not doing me justice.  I know very well that Colonel
## 1141           Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of
## 1142       losing him in the course of nature.  He may live twenty years longer.
## 1143                          But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony.&quot;
## 1144                                                                            
## 1145      &quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;thirty-five and seventeen had better not have
## 1146        any thing to do with matrimony together.  But if there should by any
## 1147     chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I should
## 1148          not think Colonel Brandon&#39;s being thirty-five any objection to his
## 1149                                                              marrying HER.&quot;
## 1150                                                                            
## 1151       &quot;A woman of seven and twenty,&quot; said Marianne, after pausing a moment,
## 1152      &quot;can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be
## 1153     uncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might bring
## 1154            herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the
## 1155             provision and security of a wife.  In his marrying such a woman
## 1156      therefore there would be nothing unsuitable.  It would be a compact of
## 1157      convenience, and the world would be satisfied.  In my eyes it would be
## 1158         no marriage at all, but that would be nothing.  To me it would seem
## 1159     only a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at the
## 1160                                                      expense of the other.&quot;
## 1161                                                                            
## 1162     &quot;It would be impossible, I know,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;to convince you that
## 1163             a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five
## 1164     anything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.
## 1165       But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the
## 1166        constant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced to
## 1167     complain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in
## 1168                                                      one of his shoulders.&quot;
## 1169                                                                            
## 1170        &quot;But he talked of flannel waistcoats,&quot; said Marianne; &quot;and with me a
## 1171               flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps,
## 1172      rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and
## 1173                                                                the feeble.&quot;
## 1174                                                                            
## 1175       &quot;Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him
## 1176     half so much.  Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to
## 1177          you in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?&quot;
## 1178                                                                            
## 1179               Soon after this, upon Elinor&#39;s leaving the room, &quot;Mama,&quot; said
## 1180         Marianne, &quot;I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot
## 1181       conceal from you.  I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well.  We have now
## 1182        been here almost a fortnight, and yet he does not come.  Nothing but
## 1183      real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.  What else
## 1184                                                 can detain him at Norland?&quot;
## 1185                                                                            
## 1186       &quot;Had you any idea of his coming so soon?&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood.  &quot;I had
## 1187            none.  On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the
## 1188     subject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of
## 1189     pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of his
## 1190                         coming to Barton.  Does Elinor expect him already?&quot;
## 1191                                                                            
## 1192                 &quot;I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must.&quot;
## 1193                                                                            
## 1194             &quot;I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her
## 1195     yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she observed
## 1196     that there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that the
## 1197                                        room would be wanted for some time.&quot;
## 1198                                                                            
## 1199      &quot;How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it!  But the whole of
## 1200         their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how
## 1201         composed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the
## 1202     last evening of their being together! In Edward&#39;s farewell there was no
## 1203             distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an
## 1204             affectionate brother to both.  Twice did I leave them purposely
## 1205       together in the course of the last morning, and each time did he most
## 1206           unaccountably follow me out of the room.  And Elinor, in quitting
## 1207       Norland and Edward, cried not as I did.  Even now her self-command is
## 1208       invariable.  When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try to
## 1209                  avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?&quot;
## 1210                                                                            
## 1211                                                                            
## 1212                                                                            
## 1213                                                                   CHAPTER 9
## 1214                                                                            
## 1215                                                                            
## 1216          The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to
## 1217     themselves.  The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding
## 1218         them, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had
## 1219     given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater
## 1220     enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of their
## 1221     father.  Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the first
## 1222        fortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at
## 1223      home, could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.
## 1224                                                                            
## 1225       Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in
## 1226       spite of Sir John&#39;s urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the
## 1227      neighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at
## 1228      their service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s spirit overcame the
## 1229      wish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining to
## 1230     visit any family beyond the distance of a walk.  There were but few who
## 1231       could be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.
## 1232          About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding
## 1233           valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly
## 1234     described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered an
## 1235       ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a little
## 1236           of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to be
## 1237           better acquainted with it.  But they learnt, on enquiry, that its
## 1238        possessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately
## 1239              too infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.
## 1240                                                                            
## 1241         The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.  The high
## 1242         downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to
## 1243          seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy
## 1244     alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior
## 1245      beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one
## 1246     memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshine
## 1247       of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which the
## 1248     settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned.  The weather was
## 1249      not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their
## 1250              book, in spite of Marianne&#39;s declaration that the day would be
## 1251         lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off
## 1252                       from their hills; and the two girls set off together.
## 1253                                                                            
## 1254        They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at
## 1255          every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the
## 1256        animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears
## 1257               which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such
## 1258                                                      delightful sensations.
## 1259                                                                            
## 1260             &quot;Is there a felicity in the world,&quot; said Marianne, &quot;superior to
## 1261                     this?--Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours.&quot;
## 1262                                                                            
## 1263     Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting
## 1264     it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly
## 1265          the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in
## 1266            their face.-- Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though
## 1267         unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own
## 1268             house.  One consolation however remained for them, to which the
## 1269       exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety; it was that of
## 1270       running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which
## 1271                                       led immediately to their garden gate.
## 1272                                                                            
## 1273        They set off.  Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step
## 1274            brought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop
## 1275     herself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the
## 1276                                                           bottom in safety.
## 1277                                                                            
## 1278        A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was
## 1279            passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her
## 1280     accident happened.  He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.  She
## 1281        had raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in
## 1282        her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.  The gentleman offered
## 1283             his services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her
## 1284       situation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther
## 1285     delay, and carried her down the hill.  Then passing through the garden,
## 1286      the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly
## 1287      into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his
## 1288                      hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.
## 1289                                                                            
## 1290     Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while
## 1291      the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret
## 1292      admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized for
## 1293            his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so
## 1294           graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, received
## 1295     additional charms from his voice and expression.  Had he been even old,
## 1296         ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would
## 1297             have been secured by any act of attention to her child; but the
## 1298           influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to the
## 1299                                     action which came home to her feelings.
## 1300                                                                            
## 1301     She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address which
## 1302       always attended her, invited him to be seated.  But this he declined,
## 1303     as he was dirty and wet.  Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she
## 1304         was obliged.  His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present
## 1305          home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him the
## 1306      honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood.  The honour
## 1307       was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself still more
## 1308                                  interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain.
## 1309                                                                            
## 1310       His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the
## 1311       theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised
## 1312               against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior
## 1313               attractions.-- Marianne herself had seen less of his Mama the
## 1314       rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting
## 1315            her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their
## 1316      entering the house.  But she had seen enough of him to join in all the
## 1317       admiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her
## 1318     praise.  His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn
## 1319         for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the
## 1320            house with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of
## 1321            thought which particularly recommended the action to her.  Every
## 1322      circumstance belonging to him was interesting.  His name was good, his
## 1323       residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that
## 1324          of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.  Her
## 1325      imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a
## 1326                                             sprained ankle was disregarded.
## 1327                                                                            
## 1328        Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather
## 1329       that morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne&#39;s accident
## 1330              being related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any
## 1331                            gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.
## 1332                                                                            
## 1333     &quot;Willoughby!&quot; cried Sir John; &quot;what, is HE in the country? That is good
## 1334           news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on
## 1335                                                                  Thursday.&quot;
## 1336                                                                            
## 1337                                    &quot;You know him then,&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood.
## 1338                                                                            
## 1339              &quot;Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is down here every year.&quot;
## 1340                                                                            
## 1341                                       &quot;And what sort of a young man is he?&quot;
## 1342                                                                            
## 1343       &quot;As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.  A very decent
## 1344                          shot, and there is not a bolder rider in England.&quot;
## 1345                                                                            
## 1346         &quot;And is that all you can say for him?&quot; cried Marianne, indignantly.
## 1347           &quot;But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his
## 1348                                         pursuits, his talents, and genius?&quot;
## 1349                                                                            
## 1350                                                Sir John was rather puzzled.
## 1351                                                                            
## 1352      &quot;Upon my soul,&quot; said he, &quot;I do not know much about him as to all THAT.
## 1353          But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicest
## 1354           little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw.  Was she out with him
## 1355                                                                     today?&quot;
## 1356                                                                            
## 1357              But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr.
## 1358       Willoughby&#39;s pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of his
## 1359                                                                       mind.
## 1360                                                                            
## 1361          &quot;But who is he?&quot; said Elinor.  &quot;Where does he come from?  Has he a
## 1362                                                         house at Allenham?&quot;
## 1363                                                                            
## 1364         On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he
## 1365             told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the
## 1366      country; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady
## 1367     at Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was
## 1368         to inherit; adding, &quot;Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I can
## 1369        tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own in
## 1370     Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up to my
## 1371             younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.  Miss
## 1372      Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.  Brandon will
## 1373                                     be jealous, if she does not take care.&quot;
## 1374                                                                            
## 1375         &quot;I do not believe,&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile,
## 1376     &quot;that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY
## 1377      daughters towards what you call CATCHING him.  It is not an employment
## 1378         to which they have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us, let
## 1379       them be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however, from what you say,
## 1380     that he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will not
## 1381                                                             be ineligible.&quot;
## 1382                                                                            
## 1383        &quot;He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived,&quot; repeated
## 1384       Sir John.  &quot;I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he
## 1385            danced from eight o&#39;clock till four, without once sitting down.&quot;
## 1386                                                                            
## 1387              &quot;Did he indeed?&quot; cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, &quot;and with
## 1388                                                     elegance, with spirit?&quot;
## 1389                                                                            
## 1390                      &quot;Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.&quot;
## 1391                                                                            
## 1392       &quot;That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be.  Whatever
## 1393       be his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, and
## 1394                                             leave him no sense of fatigue.&quot;
## 1395                                                                            
## 1396     &quot;Aye, aye, I see how it will be,&quot; said Sir John, &quot;I see how it will be.
## 1397            You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poor
## 1398                                                                   Brandon.&quot;
## 1399                                                                            
## 1400          &quot;That is an expression, Sir John,&quot; said Marianne, warmly, &quot;which I
## 1401       particularly dislike.  I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit
## 1402      is intended; and &#39;setting one&#39;s cap at a man,&#39; or &#39;making a conquest,&#39;
## 1403     are the most odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and
## 1404        if their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago
## 1405                                               destroyed all its ingenuity.&quot;
## 1406                                                                            
## 1407            Sir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed as
## 1408                                    heartily as if he did, and then replied,
## 1409                                                                            
## 1410          &quot;Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other.
## 1411        Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth
## 1412          setting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling
## 1413                                             about and spraining of ankles.&quot;
## 1414                                                                            
## 1415                                                                            
## 1416                                                                            
## 1417                                                                  CHAPTER 10
## 1418                                                                            
## 1419                                                                            
## 1420       Marianne&#39;s preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,
## 1421     styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to make
## 1422         his personal enquiries.  He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more
## 1423        than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John&#39;s account of him and
## 1424          her own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the
## 1425        visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection,
## 1426      and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced
## 1427       him.  Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview
## 1428                                                            to be convinced.
## 1429                                                                            
## 1430            Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a
## 1431         remarkably pretty figure.  Marianne was still handsomer.  Her form,
## 1432           though not so correct as her sister&#39;s, in having the advantage of
## 1433     height, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in the
## 1434      common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was less
## 1435     violently outraged than usually happens.  Her skin was very brown, but,
## 1436         from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her
## 1437      features were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in her
## 1438       eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness,
## 1439         which could hardily be seen without delight.  From Willoughby their
## 1440           expression was at first held back, by the embarrassment which the
## 1441     remembrance of his assistance created.  But when this passed away, when
## 1442              her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the perfect
## 1443       good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness and vivacity, and
## 1444     above all, when she heard him declare, that of music and dancing he was
## 1445       passionately fond, she gave him such a look of approbation as secured
## 1446     the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay.
## 1447                                                                            
## 1448      It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her
## 1449     to talk.  She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and
## 1450     she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.  They speedily
## 1451        discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and
## 1452     that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related
## 1453              to either.  Encouraged by this to a further examination of his
## 1454        opinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; her
## 1455     favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous
## 1456             a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have been
## 1457     insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellence
## 1458      of such works, however disregarded before.  Their taste was strikingly
## 1459      alike.  The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--or if
## 1460      any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer than
## 1461     till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be
## 1462              displayed.  He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her
## 1463        enthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they conversed with
## 1464                         the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.
## 1465                                                                            
## 1466        &quot;Well, Marianne,&quot; said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, &quot;for ONE
## 1467                morning I think you have done pretty well.  You have already
## 1468              ascertained Mr. Willoughby&#39;s opinion in almost every matter of
## 1469           importance.  You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are
## 1470          certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have
## 1471       received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.
## 1472               But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such
## 1473       extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?  You will soon
## 1474       have exhausted each favourite topic.  Another meeting will suffice to
## 1475     explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and
## 1476                                then you can have nothing farther to ask.&quot;--
## 1477                                                                            
## 1478      &quot;Elinor,&quot; cried Marianne, &quot;is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so
## 1479     scanty?  But I see what you mean.  I have been too much at my ease, too
## 1480        happy, too frank.  I have erred against every common-place notion of
## 1481            decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been
## 1482         reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had I talked only of the
## 1483      weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this
## 1484                                           reproach would have been spared.&quot;
## 1485                                                                            
## 1486      &quot;My love,&quot; said her mother, &quot;you must not be offended with Elinor--she
## 1487        was only in jest.  I should scold her myself, if she were capable of
## 1488              wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new
## 1489                               friend.&quot;-- Marianne was softened in a moment.
## 1490                                                                            
## 1491          Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their
## 1492        acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer.  He
## 1493         came to them every day.  To enquire after Marianne was at first his
## 1494     excuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave
## 1495      greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased
## 1496       to be possible, by Marianne&#39;s perfect recovery.  She was confined for
## 1497             some days to the house; but never had any confinement been less
## 1498               irksome.  Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick
## 1499        imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners.  He was
## 1500     exactly formed to engage Marianne&#39;s heart, for with all this, he joined
## 1501       not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was
## 1502               now roused and increased by the example of her own, and which
## 1503                   recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.
## 1504                                                                            
## 1505      His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.  They read,
## 1506     they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were considerable;
## 1507            and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had
## 1508                                                       unfortunately wanted.
## 1509                                                                            
## 1510     In Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne&#39;s; and
## 1511          Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he
## 1512       strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too
## 1513     much what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons or
## 1514          circumstances.  In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other
## 1515     people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided
## 1516      attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily the
## 1517     forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution which Elinor
## 1518        could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in
## 1519                                                                its support.
## 1520                                                                            
## 1521        Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized
## 1522       her at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her
## 1523       ideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable.  Willoughby was
## 1524         all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every
## 1525             brighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour
## 1526      declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities
## 1527                                                                were strong.
## 1528                                                                            
## 1529          Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their
## 1530     marriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before the
## 1531           end of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate
## 1532     herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.
## 1533                                                                            
## 1534          Colonel Brandon&#39;s partiality for Marianne, which had so early been
## 1535     discovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, when
## 1536        it ceased to be noticed by them.  Their attention and wit were drawn
## 1537       off to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other had
## 1538         incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his feelings
## 1539     began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility.
## 1540      Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments
## 1541     which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction, were now
## 1542      actually excited by her sister; and that however a general resemblance
## 1543       of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr.
## 1544              Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was no
## 1545       hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon.  She saw it with concern;
## 1546      for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a
## 1547      very lively one of five and twenty? and as she could not even wish him
## 1548         successful, she heartily wished him indifferent.  She liked him--in
## 1549            spite of his gravity and reserve, she beheld in him an object of
## 1550          interest.  His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve
## 1551        appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any
## 1552           natural gloominess of temper.  Sir John had dropped hints of past
## 1553       injuries and disappointments, which justified her belief of his being
## 1554       an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and compassion.
## 1555                                                                            
## 1556     Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by
## 1557      Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being neither
## 1558                 lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.
## 1559                                                                            
## 1560       &quot;Brandon is just the kind of man,&quot; said Willoughby one day, when they
## 1561          were talking of him together, &quot;whom every body speaks well of, and
## 1562     nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers
## 1563                                                                to talk to.&quot;
## 1564                                                                            
## 1565                      &quot;That is exactly what I think of him,&quot; cried Marianne.
## 1566                                                                            
## 1567         &quot;Do not boast of it, however,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;for it is injustice in
## 1568      both of you.  He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and
## 1569          I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him.&quot;
## 1570                                                                            
## 1571        &quot;That he is patronised by YOU,&quot; replied Willoughby, &quot;is certainly in
## 1572        his favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in
## 1573      itself.  Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a
## 1574           woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command the
## 1575                                             indifference of any body else?&quot;
## 1576                                                                            
## 1577         &quot;But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will
## 1578      make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother.  If their
## 1579        praise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more
## 1580                          undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust.&quot;
## 1581                                                                            
## 1582                         &quot;In defence of your protege you can even be saucy.&quot;
## 1583                                                                            
## 1584      &quot;My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will always
## 1585       have attractions for me.  Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty
## 1586     and forty.  He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad, has
## 1587       read, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him capable of giving me
## 1588         much information on various subjects; and he has always answered my
## 1589                 inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature.&quot;
## 1590                                                                            
## 1591     &quot;That is to say,&quot; cried Marianne contemptuously, &quot;he has told you, that
## 1592               in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are
## 1593                                                               troublesome.&quot;
## 1594                                                                            
## 1595      &quot;He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such inquiries,
## 1596    but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed.&quot;
## 1597                                                                            
## 1598      &quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Willoughby, &quot;his observations may have extended to the
## 1599                           existence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins.&quot;
## 1600                                                                            
## 1601     &quot;I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further
## 1602                        than your candour.  But why should you dislike him?&quot;
## 1603                                                                            
## 1604          &quot;I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary, as a very
## 1605       respectable man, who has every body&#39;s good word, and nobody&#39;s notice;
## 1606       who, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to
## 1607                                      employ, and two new coats every year.&quot;
## 1608                                                                            
## 1609     &quot;Add to which,&quot; cried Marianne, &quot;that he has neither genius, taste, nor
## 1610          spirit.  That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no
## 1611                                       ardour, and his voice no expression.&quot;
## 1612                                                                            
## 1613      &quot;You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,&quot; replied Elinor,
## 1614              &quot;and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the
## 1615             commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and
## 1616         insipid.  I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred,
## 1617     well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable
## 1618                                                                     heart.&quot;
## 1619                                                                            
## 1620     &quot;Miss Dashwood,&quot; cried Willoughby, &quot;you are now using me unkindly.  You
## 1621      are endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my
## 1622     will.  But it will not do.  You shall find me as stubborn as you can be
## 1623            artful.  I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel
## 1624     Brandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he has
## 1625      found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade him
## 1626      to buy my brown mare.  If it will be any satisfaction to you, however,
## 1627            to be told, that I believe his character to be in other respects
## 1628             irreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return for an
## 1629        acknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me the
## 1630                                privilege of disliking him as much as ever.&quot;
## 1631                                                                            
## 1632                                                                            
## 1633                                                                            
## 1634                                                                  CHAPTER 11
## 1635                                                                            
## 1636                                                                            
## 1637     Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came
## 1638       into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy their
## 1639         time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have such
## 1640     frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little
## 1641      leisure for serious employment.  Yet such was the case.  When Marianne
## 1642       was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which Sir
## 1643     John had been previously forming, were put into execution.  The private
## 1644        balls at the park then began; and parties on the water were made and
## 1645           accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.  In every
## 1646               meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and
## 1647             familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly
## 1648         calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the
## 1649      Dashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of
## 1650      Marianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,
## 1651              in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her
## 1652                                                                  affection.
## 1653                                                                            
## 1654         Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment.  She only wished
## 1655            that it were less openly shewn; and once or twice did venture to
## 1656       suggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne.  But Marianne
## 1657     abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;
## 1658      and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves
## 1659         illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but a
## 1660      disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.
## 1661       Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was an
## 1662                                             illustration of their opinions.
## 1663                                                                            
## 1664       When he was present she had no eyes for any one else.  Every thing he
## 1665     did, was right.  Every thing he said, was clever.  If their evenings at
## 1666     the park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the rest
## 1667       of the party to get her a good hand.  If dancing formed the amusement
## 1668     of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged to
## 1669         separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and
## 1670          scarcely spoke a word to any body else.  Such conduct made them of
## 1671       course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and
## 1672                                              seemed hardly to provoke them.
## 1673                                                                            
## 1674      Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left
## 1675     her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them.  To her
## 1676     it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and
## 1677                                                                ardent mind.
## 1678                                                                            
## 1679     This was the season of happiness to Marianne.  Her heart was devoted to
## 1680      Willoughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with
## 1681     her from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought it
## 1682            possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her
## 1683                                                               present home.
## 1684                                                                            
## 1685          Elinor&#39;s happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not so much at
## 1686      ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure.  They afforded
## 1687       her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind,
## 1688          nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than
## 1689     ever.  Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the
## 1690     conversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker,
## 1691     and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a
## 1692     large share of her discourse.  She had already repeated her own history
## 1693        to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor&#39;s memory been equal to
## 1694          her means of improvement, she might have known very early in their
## 1695        acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings&#39;s last illness, and
## 1696      what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died.  Lady Middleton
## 1697       was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent.  Elinor
## 1698           needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere
## 1699         calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do.  Towards her
## 1700            husband and mother she was the same as to them; and intimacy was
## 1701     therefore neither to be looked for nor desired.  She had nothing to say
## 1702           one day that she had not said the day before.  Her insipidity was
## 1703       invariable, for even her spirits were always the same; and though she
## 1704          did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband, provided every
## 1705     thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her,
## 1706       she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might
## 1707        have experienced in sitting at home;--and so little did her presence
## 1708      add to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation,
## 1709     that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her
## 1710                                      solicitude about her troublesome boys.
## 1711                                                                            
## 1712      In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find
## 1713     a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite
## 1714                the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.
## 1715        Willoughby was out of the question.  Her admiration and regard, even
## 1716               her sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his
## 1717       attentions were wholly Marianne&#39;s, and a far less agreeable man might
## 1718      have been more generally pleasing.  Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for
## 1719        himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in
## 1720            conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the
## 1721                                                 indifference of her sister.
## 1722                                                                            
## 1723         Elinor&#39;s compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect
## 1724         that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.
## 1725      This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from
## 1726        him one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by
## 1727      mutual consent, while the others were dancing.  His eyes were fixed on
## 1728       Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint
## 1729               smile, &quot;Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second
## 1730                                                               attachments.&quot;
## 1731                                                                            
## 1732                      &quot;No,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;her opinions are all romantic.&quot;
## 1733                                                                            
## 1734          &quot;Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist.&quot;
## 1735                                                                            
## 1736        &quot;I believe she does.  But how she contrives it without reflecting on
## 1737     the character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not.
## 1738     A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of
## 1739      common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to define
## 1740                 and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.&quot;
## 1741                                                                            
## 1742             &quot;This will probably be the case,&quot; he replied; &quot;and yet there is
## 1743         something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is
## 1744      sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions.&quot;
## 1745                                                                            
## 1746                   &quot;I cannot agree with you there,&quot; said Elinor.  &quot;There are
## 1747         inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne&#39;s, which all the
## 1748      charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Her
## 1749           systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at
## 1750     nought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward
## 1751                                     to as her greatest possible advantage.&quot;
## 1752                                                                            
## 1753                After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,--
## 1754                                                                            
## 1755           &quot;Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a
## 1756      second attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body?  Are those
## 1757          who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the
## 1758      inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be
## 1759                        equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?&quot;
## 1760                                                                            
## 1761     &quot;Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles.
## 1762       I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second
## 1763                                             attachment&#39;s being pardonable.&quot;
## 1764                                                                            
## 1765              &quot;This,&quot; said he, &quot;cannot hold; but a change, a total change of
## 1766     sentiments--No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements
## 1767            of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they
## 1768     succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous!  I
## 1769           speak from experience.  I once knew a lady who in temper and mind
## 1770     greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her, but who
## 1771      from an inforced change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances&quot;--
## 1772        Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said too much,
## 1773            and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might not
## 1774         otherwise have entered Elinor&#39;s head.  The lady would probably have
## 1775      passed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what
## 1776     concerned her ought not to escape his lips.  As it was, it required but
## 1777             a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender
## 1778      recollection of past regard.  Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne,
## 1779         in her place, would not have done so little.  The whole story would
## 1780     have been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing
## 1781                established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.
## 1782                                                                            
## 1783                                                                            
## 1784                                                                            
## 1785                                                                  CHAPTER 12
## 1786                                                                            
## 1787                                                                            
## 1788           As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the
## 1789        latter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of
## 1790      all that she knew before of Marianne&#39;s imprudence and want of thought,
## 1791     surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.  Marianne told her,
## 1792       with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one
## 1793      that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was
## 1794       exactly calculated to carry a woman.  Without considering that it was
## 1795       not in her mother&#39;s plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter
## 1796         her resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the
## 1797       servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable
## 1798       to receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, and
## 1799                                          told her sister of it in raptures.
## 1800                                                                            
## 1801       &quot;He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,&quot;
## 1802          she added, &quot;and when it arrives we will ride every day.  You shall
## 1803            share its use with me.  Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the
## 1804                                delight of a gallop on some of these downs.&quot;
## 1805                                                                            
## 1806           Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to
## 1807        comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for
## 1808      some time she refused to submit to them.  As to an additional servant,
## 1809      the expense would be a trifle; Mama she was sure would never object to
## 1810          it; and any horse would do for HIM; he might always get one at the
## 1811     park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.  Elinor then
## 1812      ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a
## 1813      man so little, or at least so lately known to her.  This was too much.
## 1814                                                                            
## 1815      &quot;You are mistaken, Elinor,&quot; said she warmly, &quot;in supposing I know very
## 1816      little of Willoughby.  I have not known him long indeed, but I am much
## 1817        better acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in the
## 1818     world, except yourself and mama.  It is not time or opportunity that is
## 1819      to determine intimacy;--it is disposition alone.  Seven years would be
## 1820      insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven
## 1821       days are more than enough for others.  I should hold myself guilty of
## 1822         greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from
## 1823      Willoughby.  Of John I know very little, though we have lived together
## 1824             for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.&quot;
## 1825                                                                            
## 1826         Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.  She knew her
## 1827       sister&#39;s temper.  Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach
## 1828     her the more to her own opinion.  But by an appeal to her affection for
## 1829         her mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent
## 1830         mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she
## 1831           consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly
## 1832         subdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent
## 1833       kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw
## 1834                                         him next, that it must be declined.
## 1835                                                                            
## 1836             She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the
## 1837       cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to
## 1838        him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his
## 1839             present.  The reasons for this alteration were at the same time
## 1840         related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side
## 1841               impossible.  His concern however was very apparent; and after
## 1842     expressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice,--&quot;But,
## 1843        Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now.  I
## 1844         shall keep it only till you can claim it.  When you leave Barton to
## 1845         form your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall
## 1846                                                               receive you.&quot;
## 1847                                                                            
## 1848            This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the
## 1849        sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her
## 1850        sister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so
## 1851         decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between
## 1852      them.  From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each
## 1853     other; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, or
## 1854       any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discover
## 1855                                                             it by accident.
## 1856                                                                            
## 1857           Margaret related something to her the next day, which placed this
## 1858        matter in a still clearer light.  Willoughby had spent the preceding
## 1859     evening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour
## 1860           with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations,
## 1861           which, with a most important face, she communicated to her eldest
## 1862                                  sister, when they were next by themselves.
## 1863                                                                            
## 1864            &quot;Oh, Elinor!&quot; she cried, &quot;I have such a secret to tell you about
## 1865      Marianne.  I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.&quot;
## 1866                                                                            
## 1867      &quot;You have said so,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;almost every day since they first
## 1868        met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I
## 1869       believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round
## 1870           her neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great
## 1871                                                                     uncle.&quot;
## 1872                                                                            
## 1873            &quot;But indeed this is quite another thing.  I am sure they will be
## 1874                      married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.&quot;
## 1875                                                                            
## 1876       &quot;Take care, Margaret.  It may be only the hair of some great uncle of
## 1877                                                                       HIS.&quot;
## 1878                                                                            
## 1879       &quot;But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne&#39;s. I am almost sure it is, for I
## 1880       saw him cut it off.  Last night after tea, when you and mama went out
## 1881     of the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could
## 1882     be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he took
## 1883         up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was all
## 1884     tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of
## 1885                              white paper; and put it into his pocket-book.&quot;
## 1886                                                                            
## 1887            For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not
## 1888       withhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance
## 1889             was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.
## 1890                                                                            
## 1891       Margaret&#39;s sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory
## 1892          to her sister.  When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the
## 1893         park, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor&#39;s particular
## 1894          favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,
## 1895         Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, &quot;I must not
## 1896                                                       tell, may I, Elinor?&quot;
## 1897                                                                            
## 1898        This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.
## 1899      But the effort was painful.  She was convinced that Margaret had fixed
## 1900        on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a
## 1901                                           standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.
## 1902                                                                            
## 1903       Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than good
## 1904          to the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to
## 1905                                                                   Margaret,
## 1906                                                                            
## 1907       &quot;Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to
## 1908                                                               repeat them.&quot;
## 1909                                                                            
## 1910       &quot;I never had any conjectures about it,&quot; replied Margaret; &quot;it was you
## 1911                                                who told me of it yourself.&quot;
## 1912                                                                            
## 1913           This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly
## 1914                                              pressed to say something more.
## 1915                                                                            
## 1916              &quot;Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,&quot; said Mrs.
## 1917                                  Jennings.  &quot;What is the gentleman&#39;s name?&quot;
## 1918                                                                            
## 1919        &quot;I must not tell, ma&#39;am. But I know very well what it is; and I know
## 1920                                                           where he is too.&quot;
## 1921                                                                            
## 1922      &quot;Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to be
## 1923                          sure.  He is the curate of the parish I dare say.&quot;
## 1924                                                                            
## 1925                       &quot;No, THAT he is not.  He is of no profession at all.&quot;
## 1926                                                                            
## 1927     &quot;Margaret,&quot; said Marianne with great warmth, &quot;you know that all this is
## 1928               an invention of your own, and that there is no such person in
## 1929                                                                 existence.&quot;
## 1930                                                                            
## 1931      &quot;Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such
## 1932                                 a man once, and his name begins with an F.&quot;
## 1933                                                                            
## 1934      Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this
## 1935                 moment, &quot;that it rained very hard,&quot; though she believed the
## 1936       interruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her
## 1937      ladyship&#39;s great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as
## 1938     delighted her husband and mother.  The idea however started by her, was
## 1939           immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion
## 1940      mindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of
## 1941         rain by both of them.  Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked
## 1942       Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of
## 1943      different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.  But not so
## 1944      easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her.
## 1945                                                                            
## 1946     A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a
## 1947              very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a
## 1948      brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not
## 1949     be seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orders
## 1950        on that head.  The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, and
## 1951       Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowed
## 1952        to be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, at
## 1953         least, twice every summer for the last ten years.  They contained a
## 1954     noble piece of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the
## 1955       morning&#39;s amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriages
## 1956      only to be employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of a
## 1957                                                 complete party of pleasure.
## 1958                                                                            
## 1959           To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,
## 1960      considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the
## 1961             last fortnight;--and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was
## 1962                                        persuaded by Elinor to stay at home.
## 1963                                                                            
## 1964                                                                            
## 1965                                                                            
## 1966                                                                  CHAPTER 13
## 1967                                                                            
## 1968                                                                            
## 1969         Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from
## 1970              what Elinor had expected.  She was prepared to be wet through,
## 1971     fatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, for
## 1972                                                     they did not go at all.
## 1973                                                                            
## 1974        By ten o&#39;clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they
## 1975        were to breakfast.  The morning was rather favourable, though it had
## 1976        rained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,
## 1977         and the sun frequently appeared.  They were all in high spirits and
## 1978             good humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the
## 1979             greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.
## 1980                                                                            
## 1981        While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in.  Among the
## 1982          rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he took it, looked at the
## 1983                   direction, changed colour, and immediately left the room.
## 1984                                                                            
## 1985                           &quot;What is the matter with Brandon?&quot; said Sir John.
## 1986                                                                            
## 1987                                                          Nobody could tell.
## 1988                                                                            
## 1989          &quot;I hope he has had no bad news,&quot; said Lady Middleton.  &quot;It must be
## 1990            something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my
## 1991                                               breakfast table so suddenly.&quot;
## 1992                                                                            
## 1993                                          In about five minutes he returned.
## 1994                                                                            
## 1995           &quot;No bad news, Colonel, I hope;&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as he
## 1996                                                           entered the room.
## 1997                                                                            
## 1998                                          &quot;None at all, ma&#39;am, I thank you.&quot;
## 1999                                                                            
## 2000          &quot;Was it from Avignon?  I hope it is not to say that your sister is
## 2001                                                                     worse.&quot;
## 2002                                                                            
## 2003         &quot;No, ma&#39;am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business.&quot;
## 2004                                                                            
## 2005          &quot;But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a
## 2006     letter of business?  Come, come, this won&#39;t do, Colonel; so let us hear
## 2007                                                           the truth of it.&quot;
## 2008                                                                            
## 2009      &quot;My dear madam,&quot; said Lady Middleton, &quot;recollect what you are saying.&quot;
## 2010                                                                            
## 2011         &quot;Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?&quot; said
## 2012                 Mrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter&#39;s reproof.
## 2013                                                                            
## 2014                                                    &quot;No, indeed, it is not.&quot;
## 2015                                                                            
## 2016      &quot;Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel.  And I hope she is well.&quot;
## 2017                                                                            
## 2018                     &quot;Whom do you mean, ma&#39;am?&quot; said he, colouring a little.
## 2019                                                                            
## 2020                                                  &quot;Oh! you know who I mean.&quot;
## 2021                                                                            
## 2022       &quot;I am particularly sorry, ma&#39;am,&quot; said he, addressing Lady Middleton,
## 2023       &quot;that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which
## 2024                                  requires my immediate attendance in town.&quot;
## 2025                                                                            
## 2026        &quot;In town!&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings.  &quot;What can you have to do in town at
## 2027                                                         this time of year?&quot;
## 2028                                                                            
## 2029         &quot;My own loss is great,&quot; he continued, &quot;in being obliged to leave so
## 2030       agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence
## 2031                          is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell.&quot;
## 2032                                                                            
## 2033                                         What a blow upon them all was this!
## 2034                                                                            
## 2035             &quot;But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon,&quot; said
## 2036                             Marianne, eagerly, &quot;will it not be sufficient?&quot;
## 2037                                                                            
## 2038                                                          He shook his head.
## 2039                                                                            
## 2040       &quot;We must go,&quot; said Sir John.--&quot;It shall not be put off when we are so
## 2041       near it.  You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all.&quot;
## 2042                                                                            
## 2043        &quot;I wish it could be so easily settled.  But it is not in my power to
## 2044                                              delay my journey for one day!&quot;
## 2045                                                                            
## 2046             &quot;If you would but let us know what your business is,&quot; said Mrs.
## 2047                Jennings, &quot;we might see whether it could be put off or not.&quot;
## 2048                                                                            
## 2049        &quot;You would not be six hours later,&quot; said Willoughby, &quot;if you were to
## 2050                                        defer your journey till our return.&quot;
## 2051                                                                            
## 2052                                       &quot;I cannot afford to lose ONE hour.&quot;--
## 2053                                                                            
## 2054        Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, &quot;There
## 2055     are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.  Brandon is one of
## 2056         them.  He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this
## 2057      trick for getting out of it.  I would lay fifty guineas the letter was
## 2058                                                        of his own writing.&quot;
## 2059                                                                            
## 2060                                  &quot;I have no doubt of it,&quot; replied Marianne.
## 2061                                                                            
## 2062         &quot;There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of
## 2063       old,&quot; said Sir John, &quot;when once you are determined on anything.  But,
## 2064        however, I hope you will think better of it.  Consider, here are the
## 2065      two Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked
## 2066         up from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his
## 2067                                  usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell.&quot;
## 2068                                                                            
## 2069             Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of
## 2070             disappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to be
## 2071                                                                unavoidable.
## 2072                                                                            
## 2073                                &quot;Well, then, when will you come back again?&quot;
## 2074                                                                            
## 2075        &quot;I hope we shall see you at Barton,&quot; added her ladyship, &quot;as soon as
## 2076           you can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party to
## 2077                                                  Whitwell till you return.&quot;
## 2078                                                                            
## 2079      &quot;You are very obliging.  But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in
## 2080                  my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all.&quot;
## 2081                                                                            
## 2082      &quot;Oh! he must and shall come back,&quot; cried Sir John.  &quot;If he is not here
## 2083                              by the end of the week, I shall go after him.&quot;
## 2084                                                                            
## 2085       &quot;Ay, so do, Sir John,&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings, &quot;and then perhaps you may
## 2086                                             find out what his business is.&quot;
## 2087                                                                            
## 2088           &quot;I do not want to pry into other men&#39;s concerns.  I suppose it is
## 2089                                                something he is ashamed of.&quot;
## 2090                                                                            
## 2091                                    Colonel Brandon&#39;s horses were announced.
## 2092                                                                            
## 2093               &quot;You do not go to town on horseback, do you?&quot; added Sir John.
## 2094                                                                            
## 2095                               &quot;No. Only to Honiton.  I shall then go post.&quot;
## 2096                                                                            
## 2097       &quot;Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey.  But you
## 2098                                               had better change your mind.&quot;
## 2099                                                                            
## 2100                                       &quot;I assure you it is not in my power.&quot;
## 2101                                                                            
## 2102                                      He then took leave of the whole party.
## 2103                                                                            
## 2104          &quot;Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this
## 2105                                                     winter, Miss Dashwood?&quot;
## 2106                                                                            
## 2107                                                 &quot;I am afraid, none at all.&quot;
## 2108                                                                            
## 2109       &quot;Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to
## 2110                                                                        do.&quot;
## 2111                                                                            
## 2112                              To Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.
## 2113                                                                            
## 2114     &quot;Come Colonel,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, &quot;before you go, do let us know what
## 2115                                                       you are going about.&quot;
## 2116                                                                            
## 2117     He wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the room.
## 2118                                                                            
## 2119               The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto
## 2120      restrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again and
## 2121                           again how provoking it was to be so disappointed.
## 2122                                                                            
## 2123             &quot;I can guess what his business is, however,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings
## 2124                                                                 exultingly.
## 2125                                                                            
## 2126                                   &quot;Can you, ma&#39;am?&quot; said almost every body.
## 2127                                                                            
## 2128                                &quot;Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.&quot;
## 2129                                                                            
## 2130                                 &quot;And who is Miss Williams?&quot; asked Marianne.
## 2131                                                                            
## 2132        &quot;What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have
## 2133        heard of her before.  She is a relation of the Colonel&#39;s, my dear; a
## 2134     very near relation.  We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the
## 2135       young ladies.&quot; Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,
## 2136                                              &quot;She is his natural daughter.&quot;
## 2137                                                                            
## 2138                                                                   &quot;Indeed!&quot;
## 2139                                                                            
## 2140         &quot;Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare.  I dare say the Colonel
## 2141                                            will leave her all his fortune.&quot;
## 2142                                                                            
## 2143       When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regret
## 2144        on so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as
## 2145          they were all got together, they must do something by way of being
## 2146             happy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although
## 2147           happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a
## 2148              tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country.  The
## 2149     carriages were then ordered; Willoughby&#39;s was first, and Marianne never
## 2150        looked happier than when she got into it.  He drove through the park
## 2151        very fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of them
## 2152      was seen till their return, which did not happen till after the return
## 2153     of all the rest.  They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said
## 2154     only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the others
## 2155                                                          went on the downs.
## 2156                                                                            
## 2157        It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that
## 2158        every body should be extremely merry all day long.  Some more of the
## 2159     Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly
## 2160            twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment.
## 2161       Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.
## 2162        Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor&#39;s right hand; and they had not been long
## 2163             seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said to
## 2164       Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, &quot;I have found you out in
## 2165             spite of all your tricks.  I know where you spent the morning.&quot;
## 2166                                                                            
## 2167               Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, &quot;Where, pray?&quot;--
## 2168                                                                            
## 2169            &quot;Did not you know,&quot; said Willoughby, &quot;that we had been out in my
## 2170                                                                  curricle?&quot;
## 2171                                                                            
## 2172       &quot;Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined
## 2173       to find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house, Miss
## 2174      Marianne.  It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you,
## 2175      I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when
## 2176                                                 I was there six years ago.&quot;
## 2177                                                                            
## 2178             Marianne turned away in great confusion.  Mrs. Jennings laughed
## 2179        heartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they
## 2180                had been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.
## 2181      Willoughby&#39;s groom; and that she had by that method been informed that
## 2182           they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in
## 2183                      walking about the garden and going all over the house.
## 2184                                                                            
## 2185     Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikely
## 2186     that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the house
## 2187         while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest
## 2188                                                               acquaintance.
## 2189                                                                            
## 2190      As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it;
## 2191           and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance
## 2192      related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angry
## 2193                                                   with her for doubting it.
## 2194                                                                            
## 2195       &quot;Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we
## 2196          did not see the house?  Is not it what you have often wished to do
## 2197                                                                  yourself?&quot;
## 2198                                                                            
## 2199     &quot;Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and with
## 2200                                    no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.&quot;
## 2201                                                                            
## 2202     &quot;Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew
## 2203        that house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was impossible to
## 2204         have any other companion.  I never spent a pleasanter morning in my
## 2205                                                                      life.&quot;
## 2206                                                                            
## 2207      &quot;I am afraid,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;that the pleasantness of an employment
## 2208                                      does not always evince its propriety.&quot;
## 2209                                                                            
## 2210     &quot;On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for if
## 2211       there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have been
## 2212           sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting
## 2213            wrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.&quot;
## 2214                                                                            
## 2215          &quot;But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very
## 2216        impertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of
## 2217                                                          your own conduct?&quot;
## 2218                                                                            
## 2219         &quot;If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of
## 2220     impropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives.
## 2221      I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation.  I
## 2222          am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs.
## 2223          Smith&#39;s grounds, or in seeing her house.  They will one day be Mr.
## 2224                                                        Willoughby&#39;s, and--&quot;
## 2225                                                                            
## 2226            &quot;If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be
## 2227                                           justified in what you have done.&quot;
## 2228                                                                            
## 2229        She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her;
## 2230       and after a ten minutes&#39; interval of earnest thought, she came to her
## 2231     sister again, and said with great good humour, &quot;Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS
## 2232        rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted
## 2233     particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house, I assure
## 2234      you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice
## 2235       comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it would
## 2236      be delightful.  It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.  On
## 2237          one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a
## 2238      beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the church
## 2239     and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so
## 2240         often admired.  I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be
## 2241         more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up--a
## 2242         couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the
## 2243                                       pleasantest summer-rooms in England.&quot;
## 2244                                                                            
## 2245     Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others,
## 2246        she would have described every room in the house with equal delight.
## 2247                                                                            
## 2248                                                                            
## 2249                                                                            
## 2250                                                                  CHAPTER 14
## 2251                                                                            
## 2252                                                                            
## 2253     The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon&#39;s visit at the park, with his
## 2254         steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the
## 2255              wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great
## 2256      wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all
## 2257       the comings and goings of all their acquaintance.  She wondered, with
## 2258     little intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there must
## 2259        be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that could
## 2260     have befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not escape
## 2261                                                                   them all.
## 2262                                                                            
## 2263        &quot;Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure,&quot; said she.
## 2264      &quot;I could see it in his face.  Poor man!  I am afraid his circumstances
## 2265        may be bad.  The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two
## 2266      thousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.  I do
## 2267     think he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else can
## 2268       it be?  I wonder whether it is so.  I would give anything to know the
## 2269     truth of it.  Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare
## 2270     say it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.  May be
## 2271          she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I have a
## 2272      notion she is always rather sickly.  I would lay any wager it is about
## 2273     Miss Williams.  It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his
## 2274        circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man, and to be sure must
## 2275     have cleared the estate by this time.  I wonder what it can be!  May be
## 2276     his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over.  His setting
## 2277        off in such a hurry seems very like it.  Well, I wish him out of all
## 2278           his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain.&quot;
## 2279                                                                            
## 2280       So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her opinion varying with every
## 2281           fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.
## 2282         Elinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel
## 2283     Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away,
## 2284       which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides that the
## 2285       circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or
## 2286       variety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It was
## 2287      engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby on
## 2288      the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them
## 2289      all.  As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange
## 2290        and more incompatible with the disposition of both.  Why they should
## 2291       not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant
## 2292      behaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could not
## 2293                                                                    imagine.
## 2294                                                                            
## 2295         She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in
## 2296     their power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reason
## 2297        to believe him rich.  His estate had been rated by Sir John at about
## 2298       six or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that
## 2299        income could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained of
## 2300       his poverty.  But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them
## 2301       relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all,
## 2302          she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to their
## 2303      general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mind
## 2304     of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her
## 2305                                             making any inquiry of Marianne.
## 2306                                                                            
## 2307            Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than
## 2308          Willoughby&#39;s behaviour.  To Marianne it had all the distinguishing
## 2309         tenderness which a lover&#39;s heart could give, and to the rest of the
## 2310       family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother.  The
## 2311     cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many more
## 2312           of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general
## 2313        engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him
## 2314       out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest
## 2315         of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his
## 2316                                              favourite pointer at her feet.
## 2317                                                                            
## 2318      One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the
## 2319        country, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of
## 2320      attachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s happening
## 2321     to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmly
## 2322      opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as
## 2323                                                           perfect with him.
## 2324                                                                            
## 2325          &quot;What!&quot; he exclaimed--&quot;Improve this dear cottage!  No. THAT I will
## 2326      never consent to.  Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch
## 2327                                  to its size, if my feelings are regarded.&quot;
## 2328                                                                            
## 2329       &quot;Do not be alarmed,&quot; said Miss Dashwood, &quot;nothing of the kind will be
## 2330            done; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it.&quot;
## 2331                                                                            
## 2332      &quot;I am heartily glad of it,&quot; he cried.  &quot;May she always be poor, if she
## 2333                                           can employ her riches no better.&quot;
## 2334                                                                            
## 2335            &quot;Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured that I would not
## 2336         sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one
## 2337        whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world.  Depend upon it
## 2338      that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in
## 2339      the spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it
## 2340      in a manner so painful to you.  But are you really so attached to this
## 2341                                           place as to see no defect in it?&quot;
## 2342                                                                            
## 2343      &quot;I am,&quot; said he.  &quot;To me it is faultless.  Nay, more, I consider it as
## 2344      the only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I
## 2345     rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again in
## 2346                                            the exact plan of this cottage.&quot;
## 2347                                                                            
## 2348        &quot;With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose,&quot; said
## 2349                                                                     Elinor.
## 2350                                                                            
## 2351           &quot;Yes,&quot; cried he in the same eager tone, &quot;with all and every thing
## 2352          belonging to it;--in no one convenience or INconvenience about it,
## 2353      should the least variation be perceptible.  Then, and then only, under
## 2354         such a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at
## 2355                                                                    Barton.&quot;
## 2356                                                                            
## 2357       &quot;I flatter myself,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;that even under the disadvantage
## 2358       of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your
## 2359                                 own house as faultless as you now do this.&quot;
## 2360                                                                            
## 2361          &quot;There certainly are circumstances,&quot; said Willoughby, &quot;which might
## 2362       greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of
## 2363                           my affection, which no other can possibly share.&quot;
## 2364                                                                            
## 2365        Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were
## 2366        fixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she
## 2367                                                             understood him.
## 2368                                                                            
## 2369         &quot;How often did I wish,&quot; added he, &quot;when I was at Allenham this time
## 2370     twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited!  I never passed within
## 2371         view of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one
## 2372         should live in it.  How little did I then think that the very first
## 2373      news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country,
## 2374             would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate
## 2375         satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of
## 2376       prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account
## 2377     for.  Must it not have been so, Marianne?&quot; speaking to her in a lowered
## 2378       voice.  Then continuing his former tone, he said, &quot;And yet this house
## 2379      you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  You would rob it of its simplicity by
## 2380      imaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance
## 2381      first began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by
## 2382       us together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,
## 2383            and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has
## 2384        hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort
## 2385          than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world
## 2386                                                     could possibly afford.&quot;
## 2387                                                                            
## 2388       Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should
## 2389                                                               be attempted.
## 2390                                                                            
## 2391          &quot;You are a good woman,&quot; he warmly replied.  &quot;Your promise makes me
## 2392      easy.  Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy.  Tell me
## 2393        that not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever
## 2394         find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will
## 2395              always consider me with the kindness which has made everything
## 2396                                            belonging to you so dear to me.&quot;
## 2397                                                                            
## 2398        The promise was readily given, and Willoughby&#39;s behaviour during the
## 2399          whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness.
## 2400                                                                            
## 2401      &quot;Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood, when he was
## 2402        leaving them.  &quot;I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we must
## 2403                               walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton.&quot;
## 2404                                                                            
## 2405                                 He engaged to be with them by four o&#39;clock.
## 2406                                                                            
## 2407                                                                            
## 2408                                                                            
## 2409                                                                  CHAPTER 15
## 2410                                                                            
## 2411                                                                            
## 2412        Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and
## 2413       two of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself from
## 2414      being of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and her
## 2415        mother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the
## 2416        night before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectly
## 2417                                       satisfied with her remaining at home.
## 2418                                                                            
## 2419          On their return from the park they found Willoughby&#39;s curricle and
## 2420     servant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that
## 2421       her conjecture had been just.  So far it was all as she had foreseen;
## 2422       but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her
## 2423           to expect.  They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came
## 2424       hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with her
## 2425          handkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.
## 2426         Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had
## 2427     just quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning against
## 2428      the mantel-piece with his back towards them.  He turned round on their
## 2429       coming in, and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the
## 2430                                        emotion which over-powered Marianne.
## 2431                                                                            
## 2432               &quot;Is anything the matter with her?&quot; cried Mrs. Dashwood as she
## 2433                                                      entered--&quot;is she ill?&quot;
## 2434                                                                            
## 2435        &quot;I hope not,&quot; he replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forced
## 2436      smile presently added, &quot;It is I who may rather expect to be ill--for I
## 2437                        am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!&quot;
## 2438                                                                            
## 2439                                                           &quot;Disappointment?&quot;
## 2440                                                                            
## 2441       &quot;Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you.  Mrs. Smith has
## 2442        this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent
## 2443       cousin, by sending me on business to London.  I have just received my
## 2444                dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of
## 2445                     exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.&quot;
## 2446                                                                            
## 2447                               &quot;To London!--and are you going this morning?&quot;
## 2448                                                                            
## 2449                                                       &quot;Almost this moment.&quot;
## 2450                                                                            
## 2451        &quot;This is very unfortunate.  But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and her
## 2452                          business will not detain you from us long I hope.&quot;
## 2453                                                                            
## 2454        He coloured as he replied, &quot;You are very kind, but I have no idea of
## 2455         returning into Devonshire immediately.  My visits to Mrs. Smith are
## 2456                                     never repeated within the twelvemonth.&quot;
## 2457                                                                            
## 2458     &quot;And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?  Is Allenham the only house in the
## 2459     neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?  For shame, Willoughby, can
## 2460                                           you wait for an invitation here?&quot;
## 2461                                                                            
## 2462         His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only
## 2463                                                replied, &quot;You are too good.&quot;
## 2464                                                                            
## 2465            Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.  Elinor felt equal
## 2466          amazement.  For a few moments every one was silent.  Mrs. Dashwood
## 2467                                                                first spoke.
## 2468                                                                            
## 2469         &quot;I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you
## 2470             will always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here
## 2471      immediately, because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing
## 2472     to Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question
## 2473                              your judgment than to doubt your inclination.&quot;
## 2474                                                                            
## 2475        &quot;My engagements at present,&quot; replied Willoughby, confusedly, &quot;are of
## 2476                           such a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself&quot;--
## 2477                                                                            
## 2478      He stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and another
## 2479      pause succeeded.  This was broken by Willoughby, who said with a faint
## 2480           smile, &quot;It is folly to linger in this manner.  I will not torment
## 2481            myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is
## 2482                                            impossible for me now to enjoy.&quot;
## 2483                                                                            
## 2484     He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room.  They saw him
## 2485                step into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.
## 2486                                                                            
## 2487           Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the
## 2488         parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this
## 2489                                                sudden departure occasioned.
## 2490                                                                            
## 2491     Elinor&#39;s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother&#39;s.  She thought of
## 2492     what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.  Willoughby&#39;s behaviour
## 2493              in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of
## 2494      cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother&#39;s
## 2495            invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself,
## 2496        greatly disturbed her.  One moment she feared that no serious design
## 2497        had ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunate
## 2498        quarrel had taken place between him and her sister;--the distress in
## 2499     which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could
## 2500     most reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne&#39;s
## 2501                       love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.
## 2502                                                                            
## 2503     But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sister&#39;s
## 2504              affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the tenderest
## 2505     compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability
## 2506      not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a
## 2507                                                                       duty.
## 2508                                                                            
## 2509         In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were
## 2510                                    red, her countenance was not uncheerful.
## 2511                                                                            
## 2512      &quot;Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,&quot; said she,
## 2513       as she sat down to work, &quot;and with how heavy a heart does he travel?&quot;
## 2514                                                                            
## 2515     &quot;It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work
## 2516       of a moment.  And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so
## 2517     affectionate?  And now, after only ten minutes notice--Gone too without
## 2518     intending to return!--Something more than what he owned to us must have
## 2519      happened.  He did not speak, he did not behave like himself.  YOU must
## 2520      have seen the difference as well as I.  What can it be?  Can they have
## 2521     quarrelled?  Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept
## 2522                                                    your invitation here?&quot;--
## 2523                                                                            
## 2524         &quot;It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see
## 2525         THAT.  He had not the power of accepting it.  I have thought it all
## 2526      over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at
## 2527                              first seemed strange to me as well as to you.&quot;
## 2528                                                                            
## 2529                                                          &quot;Can you, indeed!&quot;
## 2530                                                                            
## 2531      &quot;Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--but
## 2532      you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can--it will not satisfy YOU,
## 2533              I know; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I am
## 2534     persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapproves
## 2535           of it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and on that
## 2536          account is eager to get him away;--and that the business which she
## 2537          sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.
## 2538       This is what I believe to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware that
## 2539       she DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at present
## 2540           confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himself
## 2541        obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, and
## 2542      absent himself from Devonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,
## 2543      that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen to no cavil,
## 2544       unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair
## 2545           as satisfactory at this.  And now, Elinor, what have you to say?&quot;
## 2546                                                                            
## 2547                              &quot;Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.&quot;
## 2548                                                                            
## 2549     &quot;Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened.
## 2550         Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings!  You had rather
## 2551        take evil upon credit than good.  You had rather look out for misery
## 2552        for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the
## 2553     latter.  You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leave
## 2554       of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn.  And is
## 2555       no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by
## 2556         recent disappointment?  Are no probabilities to be accepted, merely
## 2557        because they are not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom we
## 2558       have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill
## 2559       of?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though
## 2560     unavoidably secret for a while?  And, after all, what is it you suspect
## 2561                                                                    him of?&quot;
## 2562                                                                            
## 2563        &quot;I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of something unpleasant is
## 2564       the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed
## 2565       in him.  There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of
## 2566      the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be
## 2567       candid in my judgment of every body.  Willoughby may undoubtedly have
## 2568       very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.
## 2569          But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at
## 2570       once.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at
## 2571                                                its being practiced by him.&quot;
## 2572                                                                            
## 2573     &quot;Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the
## 2574      deviation is necessary.  But you really do admit the justice of what I
## 2575                have said in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.&quot;
## 2576                                                                            
## 2577       &quot;Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if they
## 2578           ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--and if that is the case, it must be
## 2579           highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at
## 2580           present.  But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.&quot;
## 2581                                                                            
## 2582         &quot;Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and
## 2583        Marianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have
## 2584                        been reproaching them every day for incautiousness.&quot;
## 2585                                                                            
## 2586            &quot;I want no proof of their affection,&quot; said Elinor; &quot;but of their
## 2587                                                           engagement I do.&quot;
## 2588                                                                            
## 2589                                         &quot;I am perfectly satisfied of both.&quot;
## 2590                                                                            
## 2591       &quot;Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of
## 2592                                                                      them.&quot;
## 2593                                                                            
## 2594     &quot;I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly.  Has
## 2595       not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last
## 2596          fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future
## 2597       wife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?
## 2598       Have we not perfectly understood each other?  Has not my consent been
## 2599        daily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate
## 2600         respect?  My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement?  How
## 2601           could such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed that
## 2602     Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister&#39;s love, should leave
## 2603           her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of his
## 2604              affection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange of
## 2605                                                                confidence?&quot;
## 2606                                                                            
## 2607      &quot;I confess,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;that every circumstance except ONE is in
## 2608       favour of their engagement; but that ONE is the total silence of both
## 2609               on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.&quot;
## 2610                                                                            
## 2611      &quot;How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby,
## 2612        if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the
## 2613       nature of the terms on which they are together.  Has he been acting a
## 2614     part in his behaviour to your sister all this time?  Do you suppose him
## 2615                                                 really indifferent to her?&quot;
## 2616                                                                            
## 2617            &quot;No, I cannot think that.  He must and does love her I am sure.&quot;
## 2618                                                                            
## 2619       &quot;But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such
## 2620    indifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him.&quot;
## 2621                                                                            
## 2622       &quot;You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this
## 2623           matter as certain.  I have had my doubts, I confess; but they are
## 2624     fainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away.  If we
## 2625                  find they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed.&quot;
## 2626                                                                            
## 2627     &quot;A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see them at the altar, you
## 2628       would suppose they were going to be married.  Ungracious girl!  But I
## 2629            require no such proof.  Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to
## 2630        justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly
## 2631       open and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister&#39;s wishes.  It must
## 2632     be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?  Is he not a man of
## 2633         honour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to
## 2634                                         create alarm? can he be deceitful?&quot;
## 2635                                                                            
## 2636             &quot;I hope not, I believe not,&quot; cried Elinor.  &quot;I love Willoughby,
## 2637           sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more
## 2638        painful to yourself than to me.  It has been involuntary, and I will
## 2639      not encourage it.  I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his
## 2640           manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself, and did not
## 2641              return your kindness with any cordiality.  But all this may be
## 2642      explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed.  He
## 2643      had just parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest
## 2644           affliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs.
## 2645       Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware
## 2646     that by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away for
## 2647        some time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by
## 2648          our family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  In such a
## 2649      case, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more
## 2650          to his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general
## 2651       character;--but I will not raise objections against any one&#39;s conduct
## 2652      on so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself,
## 2653                 or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent.&quot;
## 2654                                                                            
## 2655      &quot;You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be
## 2656         suspected.  Though WE have not known him long, he is no stranger in
## 2657        this part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?
## 2658      Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,
## 2659        it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging
## 2660               everything to me at once: but this is not the case.  It is an
## 2661      engagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage
## 2662        must be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it
## 2663                                can be observed, may now be very advisable.&quot;
## 2664                                                                            
## 2665      They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was then
## 2666              at liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to
## 2667       acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.
## 2668                                                                            
## 2669         They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered the
## 2670       room and took her place at the table without saying a word.  Her eyes
## 2671          were red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even then
## 2672       restrained with difficulty.  She avoided the looks of them all, could
## 2673        neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother&#39;s silently
## 2674     pressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of fortitude
## 2675                 was quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room.
## 2676                                                                            
## 2677        This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening.  She
## 2678        was without any power, because she was without any desire of command
## 2679     over herself.  The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby
## 2680              overpowered her in an instant; and though her family were most
## 2681     anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if they
## 2682             spoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelings
## 2683                                                         connected with him.
## 2684                                                                            
## 2685                                                                            
## 2686                                                                            
## 2687                                                                  CHAPTER 16
## 2688                                                                            
## 2689                                                                            
## 2690      Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able
## 2691         to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby.  She
## 2692             would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next
## 2693         morning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than
## 2694      when she lay down in it.  But the feelings which made such composure a
## 2695         disgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it.  She was awake the
## 2696       whole night, and she wept the greatest part of it.  She got up with a
## 2697        headache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;
## 2698      giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding all
## 2699     attempt at consolation from either.  Her sensibility was potent enough!
## 2700                                                                            
## 2701       When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about
## 2702       the village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoyment
## 2703           and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning.
## 2704                                                                            
## 2705      The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling.  She played
## 2706     over every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby,
## 2707        every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat at
## 2708        the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out
## 2709       for her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be
## 2710     gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied.  She spent
## 2711     whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying; her voice
## 2712          often totally suspended by her tears.  In books too, as well as in
## 2713         music, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and
## 2714     present was certain of giving.  She read nothing but what they had been
## 2715                                                      used to read together.
## 2716                                                                            
## 2717      Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; it
## 2718     sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these employments,
## 2719     to which she daily recurred, her solitary walks and silent meditations,
## 2720            still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.
## 2721                                                                            
## 2722       No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne.
## 2723         Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy.  But Mrs.
## 2724         Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them, which at
## 2725                                                    least satisfied herself.
## 2726                                                                            
## 2727          &quot;Remember, Elinor,&quot; said she, &quot;how very often Sir John fetches our
## 2728     letters himself from the post, and carries them to it.  We have already
## 2729       agreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it
## 2730        could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through
## 2731                                                          Sir John&#39;s hands.&quot;
## 2732                                                                            
## 2733      Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried to find in it a
## 2734           motive sufficient for their silence.  But there was one method so
## 2735       direct, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real
## 2736        state of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that she
## 2737                                 could not help suggesting it to her mother.
## 2738                                                                            
## 2739     &quot;Why do you not ask Marianne at once,&quot; said she, &quot;whether she is or she
## 2740        is not engaged to Willoughby?  From you, her mother, and so kind, so
## 2741       indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence.  It would be
## 2742           the natural result of your affection for her.  She used to be all
## 2743                                     unreserve, and to you more especially.&quot;
## 2744                                                                            
## 2745      &quot;I would not ask such a question for the world.  Supposing it possible
## 2746          that they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiry
## 2747          inflict!  At any rate it would be most ungenerous.  I should never
## 2748        deserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession of
## 2749           what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.  I know
## 2750     Marianne&#39;s heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall not
## 2751       be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances make
## 2752            the revealment of it eligible.  I would not attempt to force the
## 2753        confidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty
## 2754                    would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct.&quot;
## 2755                                                                            
## 2756       Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister&#39;s
## 2757      youth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, common
## 2758            care, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s romantic
## 2759                                                                   delicacy.
## 2760                                                                            
## 2761           It was several days before Willoughby&#39;s name was mentioned before
## 2762     Marianne by any of her family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were
## 2763       not so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--but
## 2764              one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of
## 2765                                                     Shakespeare, exclaimed,
## 2766                                                                            
## 2767     &quot;We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went away
## 2768      before we could get through it.  We will put it by, that when he comes
## 2769                again...But it may be months, perhaps, before THAT happens.&quot;
## 2770                                                                            
## 2771      &quot;Months!&quot; cried Marianne, with strong surprise.  &quot;No--nor many weeks.&quot;
## 2772                                                                            
## 2773           Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said; but it gave Elinor
## 2774             pleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of
## 2775                   confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions.
## 2776                                                                            
## 2777       One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne was
## 2778            prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of
## 2779        wandering away by herself.  Hitherto she had carefully avoided every
## 2780           companion in her rambles.  If her sisters intended to walk on the
## 2781     downs, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of the
## 2782         valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be
## 2783        found when the others set off.  But at length she was secured by the
## 2784      exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.
## 2785      They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,
## 2786     for Marianne&#39;s MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied with
## 2787     gaining one point, would not then attempt more.  Beyond the entrance of
## 2788         the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less wild and
## 2789     more open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first
## 2790         coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point, they
## 2791        stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed the
## 2792         distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they had
## 2793                       never happened to reach in any of their walks before.
## 2794                                                                            
## 2795     Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated one;
## 2796       it was a man on horseback riding towards them.  In a few minutes they
## 2797         could distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment afterwards
## 2798                                             Marianne rapturously exclaimed,
## 2799                                                                            
## 2800         &quot;It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!&quot;--and was hastening to meet
## 2801                                                 him, when Elinor cried out,
## 2802                                                                            
## 2803         &quot;Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is not Willoughby.
## 2804                The person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air.&quot;
## 2805                                                                            
## 2806          &quot;He has, he has,&quot; cried Marianne, &quot;I am sure he has.  His air, his
## 2807                           coat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would come.&quot;
## 2808                                                                            
## 2809     She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne from
## 2810      particularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby,
## 2811      quickened her pace and kept up with her.  They were soon within thirty
## 2812       yards of the gentleman.  Marianne looked again; her heart sunk within
## 2813     her; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voices
## 2814      of both her sisters were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well
## 2815          known as Willoughby&#39;s, joined them in begging her to stop, and she
## 2816               turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.
## 2817                                                                            
## 2818             He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be
## 2819     forgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained a
## 2820     smile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her
## 2821                sister&#39;s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.
## 2822                                                                            
## 2823        He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back with
## 2824              them to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them.
## 2825                                                                            
## 2826        He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by
## 2827     Marianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than
## 2828       even Elinor herself.  To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward
## 2829        and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness
## 2830      which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.  On
## 2831      Edward&#39;s side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that a
## 2832          lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.  He was confused,
## 2833         seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neither
## 2834              rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by
## 2835      questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.  Marianne
## 2836      saw and listened with increasing surprise.  She began almost to feel a
## 2837     dislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, by
## 2838            carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a
## 2839               contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.
## 2840                                                                            
## 2841      After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries
## 2842     of meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London.  No,
## 2843                                      he had been in Devonshire a fortnight.
## 2844                                                                            
## 2845     &quot;A fortnight!&quot; she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the same
## 2846                               county with Elinor without seeing her before.
## 2847                                                                            
## 2848      He looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying with
## 2849                                                 some friends near Plymouth.
## 2850                                                                            
## 2851                              &quot;Have you been lately in Sussex?&quot; said Elinor.
## 2852                                                                            
## 2853                                       &quot;I was at Norland about a month ago.&quot;
## 2854                                                                            
## 2855                     &quot;And how does dear, dear Norland look?&quot; cried Marianne.
## 2856                                                                            
## 2857        &quot;Dear, dear Norland,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;probably looks much as it always
## 2858         does at this time of the year.  The woods and walks thickly covered
## 2859                                                          with dead leaves.&quot;
## 2860                                                                            
## 2861     &quot;Oh,&quot; cried Marianne, &quot;with what transporting sensation have I formerly
## 2862      seen them fall!  How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven
## 2863      in showers about me by the wind!  What feelings have they, the season,
## 2864     the air altogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.  They
## 2865       are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much as
## 2866                                                   possible from the sight.&quot;
## 2867                                                                            
## 2868          &quot;It is not every one,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;who has your passion for dead
## 2869                                                                    leaves.&quot;
## 2870                                                                            
## 2871           &quot;No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood.  But
## 2872       SOMETIMES they are.&quot;--As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for a
## 2873           few moments;--but rousing herself again, &quot;Now, Edward,&quot; said she,
## 2874     calling his attention to the prospect, &quot;here is Barton valley.  Look up
## 2875      to it, and be tranquil if you can.  Look at those hills!  Did you ever
## 2876      see their equals?  To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and
## 2877         plantations.  You may see the end of the house.  And there, beneath
## 2878        that farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.&quot;
## 2879                                                                            
## 2880         &quot;It is a beautiful country,&quot; he replied; &quot;but these bottoms must be
## 2881                                                           dirty in winter.&quot;
## 2882                                                                            
## 2883                  &quot;How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?&quot;
## 2884                                                                            
## 2885       &quot;Because,&quot; replied he, smiling, &quot;among the rest of the objects before
## 2886                                               me, I see a very dirty lane.&quot;
## 2887                                                                            
## 2888                   &quot;How strange!&quot; said Marianne to herself as she walked on.
## 2889                                                                            
## 2890     &quot;Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  Are the Middletons pleasant
## 2891                                                                    people?&quot;
## 2892                                                                            
## 2893       &quot;No, not all,&quot; answered Marianne; &quot;we could not be more unfortunately
## 2894                                                                  situated.&quot;
## 2895                                                                            
## 2896        &quot;Marianne,&quot; cried her sister, &quot;how can you say so? How can you be so
## 2897       unjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards
## 2898      us have behaved in the friendliest manner.  Have you forgot, Marianne,
## 2899                               how many pleasant days we have owed to them?&quot;
## 2900                                                                            
## 2901        &quot;No,&quot; said Marianne, in a low voice, &quot;nor how many painful moments.&quot;
## 2902                                                                            
## 2903         Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to their
## 2904       visitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, by
## 2905         talking of their present residence, its conveniences, &amp;c. extorting
## 2906        from him occasional questions and remarks.  His coldness and reserve
## 2907      mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving to
## 2908      regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present, she
## 2909      avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated him
## 2910           as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.
## 2911                                                                            
## 2912                                                                            
## 2913                                                                            
## 2914                                                                  CHAPTER 17
## 2915                                                                            
## 2916                                                                            
## 2917        Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him; for his
## 2918       coming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural.
## 2919     Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder.  He received
## 2920      the kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not
## 2921       stand against such a reception.  They had begun to fail him before he
## 2922          entered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating
## 2923      manners of Mrs. Dashwood.  Indeed a man could not very well be in love
## 2924     with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; and
## 2925             Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like
## 2926      himself.  His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his
## 2927          interest in their welfare again became perceptible.  He was not in
## 2928         spirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, was
## 2929     attentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits.  The whole family
## 2930             perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of
## 2931           liberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all
## 2932                                                            selfish parents.
## 2933                                                                            
## 2934       &quot;What are Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s views for you at present, Edward?&quot; said she,
## 2935      when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; &quot;are you still
## 2936                                 to be a great orator in spite of yourself?&quot;
## 2937                                                                            
## 2938     &quot;No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than
## 2939                                             inclination for a public life!&quot;
## 2940                                                                            
## 2941          &quot;But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to
## 2942            satisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no
## 2943      affection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find
## 2944                                                     it a difficult matter.&quot;
## 2945                                                                            
## 2946      &quot;I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be distinguished; and have
## 2947       every reason to hope I never shall.  Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced
## 2948                                                 into genius and eloquence.&quot;
## 2949                                                                            
## 2950         &quot;You have no ambition, I well know.  Your wishes are all moderate.&quot;
## 2951                                                                            
## 2952       &quot;As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe.  I wish as
## 2953         well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body
## 2954             else it must be in my own way.  Greatness will not make me so.&quot;
## 2955                                                                            
## 2956     &quot;Strange that it would!&quot; cried Marianne.  &quot;What have wealth or grandeur
## 2957                                                      to do with happiness?&quot;
## 2958                                                                            
## 2959     &quot;Grandeur has but little,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;but wealth has much to do with
## 2960                                                                        it.&quot;
## 2961                                                                            
## 2962          &quot;Elinor, for shame!&quot; said Marianne, &quot;money can only give happiness
## 2963        where there is nothing else to give it.  Beyond a competence, it can
## 2964             afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.&quot;
## 2965                                                                            
## 2966      &quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Elinor, smiling, &quot;we may come to the same point.  YOUR
## 2967       competence and MY wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and without
## 2968         them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of
## 2969      external comfort must be wanting.  Your ideas are only more noble than
## 2970                                      mine.  Come, what is your competence?&quot;
## 2971                                                                            
## 2972        &quot;About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than THAT.&quot;
## 2973                                                                            
## 2974      Elinor laughed.  &quot;TWO thousand a year! ONE is my wealth! I guessed how
## 2975                                                              it would end.&quot;
## 2976                                                                            
## 2977     &quot;And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,&quot; said Marianne.
## 2978       &quot;A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller.  I am sure I am not
## 2979           extravagant in my demands.  A proper establishment of servants, a
## 2980           carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less.&quot;
## 2981                                                                            
## 2982      Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately their
## 2983                                             future expenses at Combe Magna.
## 2984                                                                            
## 2985     &quot;Hunters!&quot; repeated Edward--&quot;but why must you have hunters?  Every body
## 2986                                                             does not hunt.&quot;
## 2987                                                                            
## 2988                     Marianne coloured as she replied, &quot;But most people do.&quot;
## 2989                                                                            
## 2990       &quot;I wish,&quot; said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, &quot;that somebody
## 2991                                  would give us all a large fortune apiece!&quot;
## 2992                                                                            
## 2993               &quot;Oh that they would!&quot; cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling with
## 2994        animation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary
## 2995                                                                  happiness.
## 2996                                                                            
## 2997      &quot;We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;in spite
## 2998                                            of the insufficiency of wealth.&quot;
## 2999                                                                            
## 3000         &quot;Oh dear!&quot; cried Margaret, &quot;how happy I should be!  I wonder what I
## 3001                                                         should do with it!&quot;
## 3002                                                                            
## 3003                       Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.
## 3004                                                                            
## 3005         &quot;I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,&quot; said Mrs.
## 3006             Dashwood, &quot;if my children were all to be rich without my help.&quot;
## 3007                                                                            
## 3008     &quot;You must begin your improvements on this house,&quot; observed Elinor, &quot;and
## 3009                                        your difficulties will soon vanish.&quot;
## 3010                                                                            
## 3011     &quot;What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London,&quot; said
## 3012               Edward, &quot;in such an event!  What a happy day for booksellers,
## 3013           music-sellers, and print-shops!  You, Miss Dashwood, would give a
## 3014      general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you--and as
## 3015        for Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music
## 3016              enough in London to content her.  And books!--Thomson, Cowper,
## 3017         Scott--she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up
## 3018        every copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands;
## 3019           and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old
## 3020          twisted tree.  Should not you, Marianne?  Forgive me, if I am very
## 3021         saucy.  But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old
## 3022                                                                  disputes.&quot;
## 3023                                                                            
## 3024     &quot;I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it be melancholy or
## 3025        gay, I love to recall it--and you will never offend me by talking of
## 3026        former times.  You are very right in supposing how my money would be
## 3027      spent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly be employed
## 3028                             in improving my collection of music and books.&quot;
## 3029                                                                            
## 3030         &quot;And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the
## 3031                                                    authors or their heirs.&quot;
## 3032                                                                            
## 3033                   &quot;No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.&quot;
## 3034                                                                            
## 3035          &quot;Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who
## 3036      wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever
## 3037      be in love more than once in their life--your opinion on that point is
## 3038                                                      unchanged, I presume?&quot;
## 3039                                                                            
## 3040       &quot;Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.  It is
## 3041         not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them.&quot;
## 3042                                                                            
## 3043       &quot;Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;she is not
## 3044                                                            at all altered.&quot;
## 3045                                                                            
## 3046                       &quot;She is only grown a little more grave than she was.&quot;
## 3047                                                                            
## 3048       &quot;Nay, Edward,&quot; said Marianne, &quot;you need not reproach me.  You are not
## 3049                                                         very gay yourself.&quot;
## 3050                                                                            
## 3051      &quot;Why should you think so!&quot; replied he, with a sigh.  &quot;But gaiety never
## 3052                                                was a part of MY character.&quot;
## 3053                                                                            
## 3054     &quot;Nor do I think it a part of Marianne&#39;s,&quot; said Elinor; &quot;I should hardly
## 3055          call her a lively girl--she is very earnest, very eager in all she
## 3056       does--sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation--but she
## 3057                                                 is not often really merry.&quot;
## 3058                                                                            
## 3059       &quot;I believe you are right,&quot; he replied, &quot;and yet I have always set her
## 3060                                                     down as a lively girl.&quot;
## 3061                                                                            
## 3062          &quot;I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,&quot; said
## 3063           Elinor, &quot;in a total misapprehension of character in some point or
## 3064           other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or
## 3065       stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the
## 3066          deception originated.  Sometimes one is guided by what they say of
## 3067           themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,
## 3068                       without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.&quot;
## 3069                                                                            
## 3070          &quot;But I thought it was right, Elinor,&quot; said Marianne, &quot;to be guided
## 3071        wholly by the opinion of other people.  I thought our judgments were
## 3072         given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours.  This has
## 3073                                      always been your doctrine, I am sure.&quot;
## 3074                                                                            
## 3075     &quot;No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of
## 3076     the understanding.  All I have ever attempted to influence has been the
## 3077      behaviour.  You must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty, I confess,
## 3078        of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with
## 3079               greater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their
## 3080             sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?&quot;
## 3081                                                                            
## 3082           &quot;You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of
## 3083         general civility,&quot; said Edward to Elinor.  &quot;Do you gain no ground?&quot;
## 3084                                                                            
## 3085     &quot;Quite the contrary,&quot; replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne.
## 3086                                                                            
## 3087     &quot;My judgment,&quot; he returned, &quot;is all on your side of the question; but I
## 3088       am afraid my practice is much more on your sister&#39;s.  I never wish to
## 3089      offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I
## 3090     am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.  I have frequently thought
## 3091       that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I
## 3092                      am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!&quot;
## 3093                                                                            
## 3094          &quot;Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers,&quot; said
## 3095                                                                     Elinor.
## 3096                                                                            
## 3097         &quot;She knows her own worth too well for false shame,&quot; replied Edward.
## 3098        &quot;Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or
## 3099      other.  If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy
## 3100                                         and graceful, I should not be shy.&quot;
## 3101                                                                            
## 3102      &quot;But you would still be reserved,&quot; said Marianne, &quot;and that is worse.&quot;
## 3103                                                                            
## 3104                        Edward started--&quot;Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?&quot;
## 3105                                                                            
## 3106                                                                &quot;Yes, very.&quot;
## 3107                                                                            
## 3108      &quot;I do not understand you,&quot; replied he, colouring.  &quot;Reserved!--how, in
## 3109                what manner?  What am I to tell you?  What can you suppose?&quot;
## 3110                                                                            
## 3111         Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to laugh off the
## 3112         subject, she said to him, &quot;Do not you know my sister well enough to
## 3113             understand what she means?  Do not you know she calls every one
## 3114          reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as
## 3115                                                    rapturously as herself?&quot;
## 3116                                                                            
## 3117      Edward made no answer.  His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him
## 3118          in their fullest extent--and he sat for some time silent and dull.
## 3119                                                                            
## 3120                                                                            
## 3121                                                                            
## 3122                                                                  CHAPTER 18
## 3123                                                                            
## 3124                                                                            
## 3125       Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend.  His
## 3126           visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his own
## 3127          enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect.  It was evident that he was
## 3128     unhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished
## 3129               her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of
## 3130       inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very
## 3131      uncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted
## 3132       one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.
## 3133                                                                            
## 3134           He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning
## 3135          before the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager to
## 3136              promote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them to
## 3137     themselves.  But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour
## 3138         door open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself
## 3139                                                                   come out.
## 3140                                                                            
## 3141        &quot;I am going into the village to see my horses,&quot; said he, &quot;as you are
## 3142              not yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently.&quot;
## 3143                                                                            
## 3144                                                                         ***
## 3145                                                                            
## 3146            Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding
## 3147          country; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the
## 3148     valley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher situation
## 3149           than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had
## 3150       exceedingly pleased him.  This was a subject which ensured Marianne&#39;s
## 3151          attention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of
## 3152     these scenes, and to question him more minutely on the objects that had
## 3153        particularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her by saying, &quot;You
## 3154     must not enquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge in the
## 3155       picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste
## 3156     if we come to particulars.  I shall call hills steep, which ought to be
## 3157         bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and
## 3158            rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be
## 3159       indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.  You must be
## 3160         satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give.  I call it a
## 3161         very fine country--the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine
## 3162        timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich meadows
## 3163          and several neat farm houses scattered here and there.  It exactly
## 3164            answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty with
## 3165     utility--and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you admire
## 3166      it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey
## 3167       moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.  I know nothing of
## 3168                                                           the picturesque.&quot;
## 3169                                                                            
## 3170        &quot;I am afraid it is but too true,&quot; said Marianne; &quot;but why should you
## 3171                                                               boast of it?&quot;
## 3172                                                                            
## 3173           &quot;I suspect,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;that to avoid one kind of affectation,
## 3174            Edward here falls into another.  Because he believes many people
## 3175       pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really
## 3176            feel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater
## 3177        indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he
## 3178      possesses.  He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.&quot;
## 3179                                                                            
## 3180     &quot;It is very true,&quot; said Marianne, &quot;that admiration of landscape scenery
## 3181          is become a mere jargon.  Every body pretends to feel and tries to
## 3182          describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what
## 3183     picturesque beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I
## 3184        have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to
## 3185       describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and
## 3186                                                                   meaning.&quot;
## 3187                                                                            
## 3188     &quot;I am convinced,&quot; said Edward, &quot;that you really feel all the delight in
## 3189     a fine prospect which you profess to feel.  But, in return, your sister
## 3190      must allow me to feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect,
## 3191         but not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked, twisted,
## 3192     blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, and
## 3193       flourishing.  I do not like ruined, tattered cottages.  I am not fond
## 3194       of nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in a
## 3195     snug farm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy, happy villages
## 3196                    please me better than the finest banditti in the world.&quot;
## 3197                                                                            
## 3198            Marianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at her
## 3199                                               sister.  Elinor only laughed.
## 3200                                                                            
## 3201                 The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remained
## 3202      thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention.
## 3203        She was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood,
## 3204     his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait
## 3205              of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.
## 3206                                                                            
## 3207          &quot;I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,&quot; she cried.  &quot;Is that
## 3208      Fanny&#39;s hair? I remember her promising to give you some.  But I should
## 3209                                     have thought her hair had been darker.&quot;
## 3210                                                                            
## 3211       Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--but when she saw
## 3212     how much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of thought
## 3213       could not be surpassed by his.  He coloured very deeply, and giving a
## 3214     momentary glance at Elinor, replied, &quot;Yes; it is my sister&#39;s hair.  The
## 3215                    setting always casts a different shade on it, you know.&quot;
## 3216                                                                            
## 3217       Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise.  That the hair
## 3218        was her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne;
## 3219            the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne
## 3220        considered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must
## 3221         have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.
## 3222           She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and
## 3223         affecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of
## 3224         something else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch every
## 3225        opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all
## 3226                            doubt, that it was exactly the shade of her own.
## 3227                                                                            
## 3228      Edward&#39;s embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of
## 3229      mind still more settled.  He was particularly grave the whole morning.
## 3230       Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said; but her own
## 3231           forgiveness might have been more speedy, had she known how little
## 3232                                            offence it had given her sister.
## 3233                                                                            
## 3234        Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs.
## 3235            Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the
## 3236        cottage, came to take a survey of the guest.  With the assistance of
## 3237       his mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the name
## 3238     of Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of raillery
## 3239          against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of their
## 3240        acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediately
## 3241       sprung.  But, as it was, she only learned, from some very significant
## 3242       looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret&#39;s instructions,
## 3243                                                                   extended.
## 3244                                                                            
## 3245        Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to
## 3246      dine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening.
## 3247     On the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their visitor,
## 3248      towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute, he wished
## 3249                                                    to engage them for both.
## 3250                                                                            
## 3251      &quot;You MUST drink tea with us to night,&quot; said he, &quot;for we shall be quite
## 3252     alone--and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we shall be a
## 3253                                                               large party.&quot;
## 3254                                                                            
## 3255     Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity.  &quot;And who knows but you may raise
## 3256              a dance,&quot; said she.  &quot;And that will tempt YOU, Miss Marianne.&quot;
## 3257                                                                            
## 3258                  &quot;A dance!&quot; cried Marianne.  &quot;Impossible! Who is to dance?&quot;
## 3259                                                                            
## 3260      &quot;Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to be sure.--What!
## 3261       you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be
## 3262                                                          nameless is gone!&quot;
## 3263                                                                            
## 3264      &quot;I wish with all my soul,&quot; cried Sir John, &quot;that Willoughby were among
## 3265                                                                  us again.&quot;
## 3266                                                                            
## 3267     This, and Marianne&#39;s blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward.  &quot;And who
## 3268       is Willoughby?&quot; said he, in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom he
## 3269                                                                was sitting.
## 3270                                                                            
## 3271                She gave him a brief reply.  Marianne&#39;s countenance was more
## 3272       communicative.  Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning
## 3273            of others, but such of Marianne&#39;s expressions as had puzzled him
## 3274        before; and when their visitors left them, he went immediately round
## 3275       her, and said, in a whisper, &quot;I have been guessing.  Shall I tell you
## 3276                                                                  my guess?&quot;
## 3277                                                                            
## 3278                                                         &quot;What do you mean?&quot;
## 3279                                                                            
## 3280                                                         &quot;Shall I tell you.&quot;
## 3281                                                                            
## 3282                                                                &quot;Certainly.&quot;
## 3283                                                                            
## 3284                             &quot;Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.&quot;
## 3285                                                                            
## 3286      Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling at
## 3287       the quiet archness of his manner, and after a moment&#39;s silence, said,
## 3288                                                                            
## 3289        &quot;Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come I hope...I am sure
## 3290                                                         you will like him.&quot;
## 3291                                                                            
## 3292       &quot;I do not doubt it,&quot; replied he, rather astonished at her earnestness
## 3293     and warmth; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her
## 3294           acquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothing
## 3295           between Mr. Willoughby and herself, he would not have ventured to
## 3296                                                                 mention it.
## 3297                                                                            
## 3298                                                                            
## 3299                                                                            
## 3300                                                                  CHAPTER 19
## 3301                                                                            
## 3302                                                                            
## 3303     Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs.
## 3304                    Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only on
## 3305        self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment
## 3306      among his friends was at the height.  His spirits, during the last two
## 3307         or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he
## 3308        grew more and more partial to the house and environs--never spoke of
## 3309                   going away without a sigh--declared his time to be wholly
## 3310            disengaged--even doubted to what place he should go when he left
## 3311      them--but still, go he must.  Never had any week passed so quickly--he
## 3312           could hardly believe it to be gone.  He said so repeatedly; other
## 3313      things he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the
## 3314       lie to his actions.  He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested being
## 3315      in town; but either to Norland or London, he must go.  He valued their
## 3316     kindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was in being with
## 3317      them.  Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of their
## 3318                  wishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time.
## 3319                                                                            
## 3320         Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his
## 3321       mother&#39;s account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose
## 3322      character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse
## 3323     for every thing strange on the part of her son.  Disappointed, however,
## 3324           and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain
## 3325     behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to regard
## 3326     his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,
## 3327                 which had been rather more painfully extorted from her, for
## 3328     Willoughby&#39;s service, by her mother.  His want of spirits, of openness,
## 3329             and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want of
## 3330        independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s disposition
## 3331     and designs.  The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose
## 3332      in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the same
## 3333               inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.  The old
## 3334      well-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child,
## 3335          was the cause of all.  She would have been glad to know when these
## 3336        difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs.
## 3337      Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.  But
## 3338     from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal
## 3339        of her confidence in Edward&#39;s affection, to the remembrance of every
## 3340     mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton, and
## 3341     above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round
## 3342                                                                 his finger.
## 3343                                                                            
## 3344        &quot;I think, Edward,&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the
## 3345      last morning, &quot;you would be a happier man if you had any profession to
## 3346      engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions.  Some
## 3347      inconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you would
## 3348      not be able to give them so much of your time.  But (with a smile) you
## 3349         would be materially benefited in one particular at least--you would
## 3350                                       know where to go when you left them.&quot;
## 3351                                                                            
## 3352     &quot;I do assure you,&quot; he replied, &quot;that I have long thought on this point,
## 3353       as you think now.  It has been, and is, and probably will always be a
## 3354     heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage
## 3355        me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing like
## 3356        independence.  But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of my
## 3357         friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being.  We never
## 3358          could agree in our choice of a profession.  I always preferred the
## 3359        church, as I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family.
## 3360         They recommended the army.  That was a great deal too smart for me.
## 3361           The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had
## 3362            chambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first
## 3363           circles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had no
## 3364      inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which
## 3365     my family approved.  As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I
## 3366         was too old when the subject was first started to enter it--and, at
## 3367      length, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all,
## 3368     as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as
## 3369      with one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous
## 3370            and honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so
## 3371          earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his
## 3372     friends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been
## 3373                                                  properly idle ever since.&quot;
## 3374                                                                            
## 3375         &quot;The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood,
## 3376     &quot;since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons will
## 3377     be brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades
## 3378                                                            as Columella&#39;s.&quot;
## 3379                                                                            
## 3380          &quot;They will be brought up,&quot; said he, in a serious accent, &quot;to be as
## 3381      unlike myself as is possible.  In feeling, in action, in condition, in
## 3382                                                               every thing.&quot;
## 3383                                                                            
## 3384          &quot;Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits,
## 3385      Edward.  You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike
## 3386         yourself must be happy.  But remember that the pain of parting from
## 3387              friends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their
## 3388         education or state.  Know your own happiness.  You want nothing but
## 3389           patience--or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope.  Your
## 3390            mother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so
## 3391       anxious for; it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her
## 3392      happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.
## 3393                                          How much may not a few months do?&quot;
## 3394                                                                            
## 3395      &quot;I think,&quot; replied Edward, &quot;that I may defy many months to produce any
## 3396                                                                good to me.&quot;
## 3397                                                                            
## 3398        This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to
## 3399       Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which
## 3400        shortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor&#39;s
## 3401        feelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.
## 3402        But as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself
## 3403      from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his
## 3404         going away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by
## 3405          Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by
## 3406      seeking silence, solitude and idleness.  Their means were as different
## 3407            as their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.
## 3408                                                                            
## 3409           Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the
## 3410            house, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor
## 3411     avoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost as
## 3412         much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this
## 3413        conduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented
## 3414      from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much
## 3415                                                  solicitude on her account.
## 3416                                                                            
## 3417      Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no
## 3418        more meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her.
## 3419          The business of self-command she settled very easily;--with strong
## 3420        affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.
## 3421      That her sister&#39;s affections WERE calm, she dared not deny, though she
## 3422       blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she gave a
## 3423         very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that sister, in
## 3424                                        spite of this mortifying conviction.
## 3425                                                                            
## 3426        Without shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house in
## 3427        determined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to
## 3428      indulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough
## 3429            to think of Edward, and of Edward&#39;s behaviour, in every possible
## 3430         variety which the different state of her spirits at different times
## 3431     could produce,--with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.
## 3432         There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her
## 3433            mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,
## 3434     conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude was
## 3435       produced.  Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could not
## 3436          be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so
## 3437      interesting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross
## 3438                                  her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.
## 3439                                                                            
## 3440       From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawing-table, she was
## 3441     roused one morning, soon after Edward&#39;s leaving them, by the arrival of
## 3442        company.  She happened to be quite alone.  The closing of the little
## 3443        gate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew
## 3444         her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the
## 3445     door.  Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,
## 3446     but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite unknown
## 3447           to her.  She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir John
## 3448             perceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of
## 3449     knocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open
## 3450     the casement to speak to him, though the space was so short between the
## 3451          door and the window, as to make it hardly possible to speak at one
## 3452                                           without being heard at the other.
## 3453                                                                            
## 3454      &quot;Well,&quot; said he, &quot;we have brought you some strangers.  How do you like
## 3455                                                                      them?&quot;
## 3456                                                                            
## 3457                                                 &quot;Hush! they will hear you.&quot;
## 3458                                                                            
## 3459         &quot;Never mind if they do.  It is only the Palmers.  Charlotte is very
## 3460             pretty, I can tell you.  You may see her if you look this way.&quot;
## 3461                                                                            
## 3462         As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, without
## 3463                              taking that liberty, she begged to be excused.
## 3464                                                                            
## 3465         &quot;Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we are come? I see her
## 3466                                                        instrument is open.&quot;
## 3467                                                                            
## 3468                                                &quot;She is walking, I believe.&quot;
## 3469                                                                            
## 3470       They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough to
## 3471          wait till the door was opened before she told HER story.  She came
## 3472            hallooing to the window, &quot;How do you do, my dear?  How does Mrs.
## 3473     Dashwood do?  And where are your sisters?  What! all alone! you will be
## 3474      glad of a little company to sit with you.  I have brought my other son
## 3475        and daughter to see you.  Only think of their coming so suddenly!  I
## 3476      thought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,
## 3477           but it never entered my head that it could be them.  I thought of
## 3478     nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again; so
## 3479     I said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel
## 3480                                                  Brandon come back again&quot;--
## 3481                                                                            
## 3482         Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, to
## 3483            receive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the two
## 3484          strangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same
## 3485     time, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings
## 3486     continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour,
## 3487                                                       attended by Sir John.
## 3488                                                                            
## 3489      Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally
## 3490           unlike her in every respect.  She was short and plump, had a very
## 3491      pretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could
## 3492      possibly be.  Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister&#39;s,
## 3493           but they were much more prepossessing.  She came in with a smile,
## 3494       smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled
## 3495      when she went away.  Her husband was a grave looking young man of five
## 3496     or six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife,
## 3497       but of less willingness to please or be pleased.  He entered the room
## 3498      with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without
## 3499                speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their
## 3500       apartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read
## 3501                                                     it as long as he staid.
## 3502                                                                            
## 3503     Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with a
## 3504      turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before her
## 3505                admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.
## 3506                                                                            
## 3507              &quot;Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so
## 3508      charming!  Only think, Mama, how it is improved since I was here last!
## 3509             I always thought it such a sweet place, ma&#39;am! (turning to Mrs.
## 3510         Dashwood) but you have made it so charming!  Only look, sister, how
## 3511       delightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself!
## 3512                                                Should not you, Mr. Palmer?&quot;
## 3513                                                                            
## 3514     Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from the
## 3515                                                                  newspaper.
## 3516                                                                            
## 3517           &quot;Mr. Palmer does not hear me,&quot; said she, laughing; &quot;he never does
## 3518                                           sometimes.  It is so ridiculous!&quot;
## 3519                                                                            
## 3520      This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used to
## 3521     find wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking with
## 3522                                                      surprise at them both.
## 3523                                                                            
## 3524         Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she could, and
## 3525      continued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing
## 3526      their friends, without ceasing till every thing was told.  Mrs. Palmer
## 3527       laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every
## 3528             body agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite an
## 3529                                                         agreeable surprise.
## 3530                                                                            
## 3531              &quot;You may believe how glad we all were to see them,&quot; added Mrs.
## 3532       Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice
## 3533      as if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on
## 3534       different sides of the room; &quot;but, however, I can&#39;t help wishing they
## 3535        had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it,
## 3536        for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for
## 3537        you know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was
## 3538         wrong in her situation.  I wanted her to stay at home and rest this
## 3539    morning, but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you all!&quot;
## 3540                                                                            
## 3541                 Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her any harm.
## 3542                                                                            
## 3543          &quot;She expects to be confined in February,&quot; continued Mrs. Jennings.
## 3544                                                                            
## 3545              Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, and
## 3546        therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in
## 3547                                                                  the paper.
## 3548                                                                            
## 3549                                 &quot;No, none at all,&quot; he replied, and read on.
## 3550                                                                            
## 3551       &quot;Here comes Marianne,&quot; cried Sir John.  &quot;Now, Palmer, you shall see a
## 3552                                                     monstrous pretty girl.&quot;
## 3553                                                                            
## 3554            He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and
## 3555            ushered her in himself.  Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as she
## 3556       appeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so
## 3557         heartily at the question, as to show she understood it.  Mr. Palmer
## 3558         looked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and
## 3559        then returned to his newspaper.  Mrs. Palmer&#39;s eye was now caught by
## 3560        the drawings which hung round the room.  She got up to examine them.
## 3561                                                                            
## 3562          &quot;Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!  Well! how delightful!  Do but
## 3563      look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could look
## 3564        at them for ever.&quot; And then sitting down again, she very soon forgot
## 3565                                that there were any such things in the room.
## 3566                                                                            
## 3567        When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid down
## 3568             the newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around.
## 3569                                                                            
## 3570                   &quot;My love, have you been asleep?&quot; said his wife, laughing.
## 3571                                                                            
## 3572         He made her no answer; and only observed, after again examining the
## 3573       room, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked.
## 3574                           He then made his bow, and departed with the rest.
## 3575                                                                            
## 3576        Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at
## 3577       the park.  Mrs. Dashwood, who did not chuse to dine with them oftener
## 3578      than they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;
## 3579       her daughters might do as they pleased.  But they had no curiosity to
## 3580         see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of
## 3581            pleasure from them in any other way.  They attempted, therefore,
## 3582          likewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and not
## 3583       likely to be good.  But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage
## 3584     should be sent for them and they must come.  Lady Middleton too, though
## 3585       she did not press their mother, pressed them.  Mrs. Jennings and Mrs.
## 3586       Palmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid a
## 3587                   family party; and the young ladies were obliged to yield.
## 3588                                                                            
## 3589         &quot;Why should they ask us?&quot; said Marianne, as soon as they were gone.
## 3590         &quot;The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very
## 3591       hard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying
## 3592                                              either with them, or with us.&quot;
## 3593                                                                            
## 3594        &quot;They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;by
## 3595     these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them a
## 3596         few weeks ago.  The alteration is not in them, if their parties are
## 3597            grown tedious and dull.  We must look for the change elsewhere.&quot;
## 3598

## 3604         As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next
## 3605      day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as
## 3606                  good humoured and merry as before.  She took them all most
## 3607      affectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing them
## 3608                                                                      again.
## 3609                                                                            
## 3610     &quot;I am so glad to see you!&quot; said she, seating herself between Elinor and
## 3611          Marianne, &quot;for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come,
## 3612      which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must
## 3613          go, for the Westons come to us next week you know.  It was quite a
## 3614           sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the
## 3615          carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I
## 3616         would go with him to Barton.  He is so droll! He never tells me any
## 3617     thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet again
## 3618                                                 in town very soon, I hope.&quot;
## 3619                                                                            
## 3620                     They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.
## 3621                                                                            
## 3622        &quot;Not go to town!&quot; cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, &quot;I shall be quite
## 3623  disappointed if you do not.  I could get the nicest house in the world for
## 3624       you, next door to ours, in Hanover-square.  You must come, indeed.  I
## 3625         am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am
## 3626              confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public.&quot;
## 3627                                                                            
## 3628            They thanked her; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties.
## 3629                                                                            
## 3630      &quot;Oh, my love,&quot; cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband, who just then entered
## 3631         the room--&quot;you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to
## 3632                                                          town this winter.&quot;
## 3633                                                                            
## 3634     Her love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies, began
## 3635                                                 complaining of the weather.
## 3636                                                                            
## 3637     &quot;How horrid all this is!&quot; said he.  &quot;Such weather makes every thing and
## 3638        every body disgusting.  Dullness is as much produced within doors as
## 3639        without, by rain.  It makes one detest all one&#39;s acquaintance.  What
## 3640           the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his
## 3641      house?  How few people know what comfort is!  Sir John is as stupid as
## 3642                                                               the weather.&quot;
## 3643                                                                            
## 3644                                      The rest of the company soon dropt in.
## 3645                                                                            
## 3646     &quot;I am afraid, Miss Marianne,&quot; said Sir John, &quot;you have not been able to
## 3647                                    take your usual walk to Allenham today.&quot;
## 3648                                                                            
## 3649                                Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.
## 3650                                                                            
## 3651         &quot;Oh, don&#39;t be so sly before us,&quot; said Mrs. Palmer; &quot;for we know all
## 3652      about it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think
## 3653       he is extremely handsome.  We do not live a great way from him in the
## 3654                       country, you know.  Not above ten miles, I dare say.&quot;
## 3655                                                                            
## 3656                                     &quot;Much nearer thirty,&quot; said her husband.
## 3657                                                                            
## 3658     &quot;Ah, well! there is not much difference.  I never was at his house; but
## 3659                                       they say it is a sweet pretty place.&quot;
## 3660                                                                            
## 3661                 &quot;As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,&quot; said Mr. Palmer.
## 3662                                                                            
## 3663     Marianne remained perfectly silent, though her countenance betrayed her
## 3664                                                  interest in what was said.
## 3665                                                                            
## 3666       &quot;Is it very ugly?&quot; continued Mrs. Palmer--&quot;then it must be some other
## 3667                                         place that is so pretty I suppose.&quot;
## 3668                                                                            
## 3669     When they were seated in the dining room, Sir John observed with regret
## 3670                                     that they were only eight all together.
## 3671                                                                            
## 3672     &quot;My dear,&quot; said he to his lady, &quot;it is very provoking that we should be
## 3673             so few.  Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today?&quot;
## 3674                                                                            
## 3675        &quot;Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before,
## 3676                       that it could not be done?  They dined with us last.&quot;
## 3677                                                                            
## 3678      &quot;You and I, Sir John,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, &quot;should not stand upon such
## 3679                                                                  ceremony.&quot;
## 3680                                                                            
## 3681                        &quot;Then you would be very ill-bred,&quot; cried Mr. Palmer.
## 3682                                                                            
## 3683           &quot;My love you contradict every body,&quot; said his wife with her usual
## 3684                              laugh.  &quot;Do you know that you are quite rude?&quot;
## 3685                                                                            
## 3686              &quot;I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother
## 3687                                                                  ill-bred.&quot;
## 3688                                                                            
## 3689       &quot;Ay, you may abuse me as you please,&quot; said the good-natured old lady,
## 3690     &quot;you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back again.
## 3691                                      So there I have the whip hand of you.&quot;
## 3692                                                                            
## 3693      Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid
## 3694      of her; and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her,
## 3695       as they must live together.  It was impossible for any one to be more
## 3696           thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs.
## 3697         Palmer.  The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of her
## 3698        husband gave her no pain; and when he scolded or abused her, she was
## 3699                                                            highly diverted.
## 3700                                                                            
## 3701        &quot;Mr. Palmer is so droll!&quot; said she, in a whisper, to Elinor.  &quot;He is
## 3702                                                      always out of humour.&quot;
## 3703                                                                            
## 3704     Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him credit
## 3705       for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he
## 3706           wished to appear.  His temper might perhaps be a little soured by
## 3707       finding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable
## 3708                bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly
## 3709       woman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any
## 3710          sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.-- It was rather a wish of
## 3711     distinction, she believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment of
## 3712        every body, and his general abuse of every thing before him.  It was
## 3713       the desire of appearing superior to other people.  The motive was too
## 3714      common to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed by
## 3715     establishing his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach
## 3716                                             any one to him except his wife.
## 3717                                                                            
## 3718      &quot;Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,&quot; said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, &quot;I have
## 3719         got such a favour to ask of you and your sister.  Will you come and
## 3720       spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas?  Now, pray do,--and come
## 3721      while the Westons are with us.  You cannot think how happy I shall be!
## 3722     It will be quite delightful!--My love,&quot; applying to her husband, &quot;don&#39;t
## 3723                     you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?&quot;
## 3724                                                                            
## 3725      &quot;Certainly,&quot; he replied, with a sneer--&quot;I came into Devonshire with no
## 3726                                                                other view.&quot;
## 3727                                                                            
## 3728        &quot;There now,&quot;--said his lady, &quot;you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you
## 3729                                                     cannot refuse to come.&quot;
## 3730                                                                            
## 3731                   They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.
## 3732                                                                            
## 3733     &quot;But indeed you must and shall come.  I am sure you will like it of all
## 3734      things.  The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful.
## 3735         You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay
## 3736            now, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing
## 3737        against the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I
## 3738       never saw before, it is quite charming!  But, poor fellow! it is very
## 3739            fatiguing to him! for he is forced to make every body like him.&quot;
## 3740                                                                            
## 3741             Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the
## 3742                                             hardship of such an obligation.
## 3743                                                                            
## 3744                   &quot;How charming it will be,&quot; said Charlotte, &quot;when he is in
## 3745      Parliament!--won&#39;t it? How I shall laugh!  It will be so ridiculous to
## 3746       see all his letters directed to him with an M.P.--But do you know, he
## 3747        says, he will never frank for me?  He declares he won&#39;t.  Don&#39;t you,
## 3748                                                                Mr. Palmer?&quot;
## 3749                                                                            
## 3750                                           Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.
## 3751                                                                            
## 3752     &quot;He cannot bear writing, you know,&quot; she continued--&quot;he says it is quite
## 3753                                                                  shocking.&quot;
## 3754                                                                            
## 3755       &quot;No,&quot; said he, &quot;I never said any thing so irrational.  Don&#39;t palm all
## 3756                                          your abuses of languages upon me.&quot;
## 3757                                                                            
## 3758      &quot;There now; you see how droll he is.  This is always the way with him!
## 3759         Sometimes he won&#39;t speak to me for half a day together, and then he
## 3760       comes out with something so droll--all about any thing in the world.&quot;
## 3761                                                                            
## 3762      She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room,
## 3763              by asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.
## 3764                                                                            
## 3765                        &quot;Certainly,&quot; said Elinor; &quot;he seems very agreeable.&quot;
## 3766                                                                            
## 3767        &quot;Well--I am so glad you do.  I thought you would, he is so pleasant;
## 3768       and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can
## 3769      tell you, and you can&#39;t think how disappointed he will be if you don&#39;t
## 3770           come to Cleveland.--I can&#39;t imagine why you should object to it.&quot;
## 3771                                                                            
## 3772     Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing the
## 3773     subject, put a stop to her entreaties.  She thought it probable that as
## 3774       they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some
## 3775       more particular account of Willoughby&#39;s general character, than could
## 3776     be gathered from the Middletons&#39; partial acquaintance with him; and she
## 3777        was eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of his merits as
## 3778           might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne.  She began by
## 3779      inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland, and whether
## 3780                                   they were intimately acquainted with him.
## 3781                                                                            
## 3782       &quot;Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,&quot; replied Mrs. Palmer;--&quot;Not
## 3783     that I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.
## 3784      Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was
## 3785       at Allenham.  Mama saw him here once before;--but I was with my uncle
## 3786       at Weymouth.  However, I dare say we should have seen a great deal of
## 3787         him in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily that we
## 3788       should never have been in the country together.  He is very little at
## 3789     Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do not think Mr.
## 3790          Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you know, and
## 3791       besides it is such a way off.  I know why you inquire about him, very
## 3792     well; your sister is to marry him.  I am monstrous glad of it, for then
## 3793                                 I shall have her for a neighbour you know.&quot;
## 3794                                                                            
## 3795      &quot;Upon my word,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;you know much more of the matter than
## 3796                       I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match.&quot;
## 3797                                                                            
## 3798     &quot;Don&#39;t pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body talks
## 3799                    of.  I assure you I heard of it in my way through town.&quot;
## 3800                                                                            
## 3801                                                      &quot;My dear Mrs. Palmer!&quot;
## 3802                                                                            
## 3803             &quot;Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in
## 3804      Bond-street, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly.&quot;
## 3805                                                                            
## 3806        &quot;You surprise me very much.  Colonel Brandon tell you of it!  Surely
## 3807      you must be mistaken.  To give such intelligence to a person who could
## 3808         not be interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should
## 3809                                              expect Colonel Brandon to do.&quot;
## 3810                                                                            
## 3811       &quot;But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how
## 3812       it happened.  When we met him, he turned back and walked with us; and
## 3813             so we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and
## 3814     another, and I said to him, &#39;So, Colonel, there is a new family come to
## 3815        Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very pretty,
## 3816      and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe
## 3817     Magna.  Is it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you have been
## 3818                                                  in Devonshire so lately.&#39;&quot;
## 3819                                                                            
## 3820                                             &quot;And what did the Colonel say?&quot;
## 3821                                                                            
## 3822     &quot;Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true, so
## 3823                from that moment I set it down as certain.  It will be quite
## 3824                          delightful, I declare!  When is it to take place?&quot;
## 3825                                                                            
## 3826                                         &quot;Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?&quot;
## 3827                                                                            
## 3828       &quot;Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing but
## 3829                                                    say fine things of you.&quot;
## 3830                                                                            
## 3831      &quot;I am flattered by his commendation.  He seems an excellent man; and I
## 3832                                             think him uncommonly pleasing.&quot;
## 3833                                                                            
## 3834     &quot;So do I.--He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should
## 3835         be so grave and so dull.  Mama says HE was in love with your sister
## 3836      too.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly
## 3837                                          ever falls in love with any body.&quot;
## 3838                                                                            
## 3839          &quot;Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?&quot; said
## 3840                                                                     Elinor.
## 3841                                                                            
## 3842         &quot;Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are
## 3843        acquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all
## 3844      think him extremely agreeable I assure you.  Nobody is more liked than
## 3845      Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.  She
## 3846       is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he
## 3847      is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and
## 3848       agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her.  However, I don&#39;t
## 3849       think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think
## 3850          you both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,
## 3851                          though we could not get him to own it last night.&quot;
## 3852                                                                            
## 3853      Mrs. Palmer&#39;s information respecting Willoughby was not very material;
## 3854        but any testimony in his favour, however small, was pleasing to her.
## 3855                                                                            
## 3856                     &quot;I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,&quot; continued
## 3857          Charlotte.--&quot;And now I hope we shall always be great friends.  You
## 3858     can&#39;t think how much I longed to see you!  It is so delightful that you
## 3859     should live at the cottage!  Nothing can be like it, to be sure!  And I
## 3860     am so glad your sister is going to be well married!  I hope you will be
## 3861        a great deal at Combe Magna.  It is a sweet place, by all accounts.&quot;
## 3862                                                                            
## 3863         &quot;You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?&quot;
## 3864                                                                            
## 3865               &quot;Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married.-- He was a
## 3866      particular friend of Sir John&#39;s. I believe,&quot; she added in a low voice,
## 3867        &quot;he would have been very glad to have had me, if he could.  Sir John
## 3868         and Lady Middleton wished it very much.  But mama did not think the
## 3869     match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to
## 3870                  the Colonel, and we should have been married immediately.&quot;
## 3871                                                                            
## 3872         &quot;Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John&#39;s proposal to your mother
## 3873         before it was made?  Had he never owned his affection to yourself?&quot;
## 3874                                                                            
## 3875       &quot;Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have
## 3876        liked it of all things.  He had not seen me then above twice, for it
## 3877         was before I left school.  However, I am much happier as I am.  Mr.
## 3878                                          Palmer is the kind of man I like.&quot;
## 3879                                                                            
## 3880                                                                            
## 3881                                                                            
## 3882                                                                  CHAPTER 21
## 3883                                                                            
## 3884                                                                            
## 3885     The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families at
## 3886      Barton were again left to entertain each other.  But this did not last
## 3887        long; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head, had
## 3888     hardly done wondering at Charlotte&#39;s being so happy without a cause, at
## 3889      Mr. Palmer&#39;s acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strange
## 3890     unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before Sir
## 3891             John&#39;s and Mrs. Jennings&#39;s active zeal in the cause of society,
## 3892                procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe.
## 3893                                                                            
## 3894     In a morning&#39;s excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young ladies,
## 3895            whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her
## 3896      relations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to
## 3897         the park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.
## 3898               Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an
## 3899       invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the
## 3900          return of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive a
## 3901      visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose
## 3902     elegance,--whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof; for
## 3903           the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for
## 3904          nothing at all.  Their being her relations too made it so much the
## 3905           worse; and Mrs. Jennings&#39;s attempts at consolation were therefore
## 3906      unfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about
## 3907      their being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put
## 3908         up with one another.  As it was impossible, however, now to prevent
## 3909       their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with
## 3910     all the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with merely
## 3911      giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times
## 3912                                                                  every day.
## 3913                                                                            
## 3914     The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel or
## 3915       unfashionable.  Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil,
## 3916     they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,
## 3917             and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady
## 3918        Middleton&#39;s good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had
## 3919     been an hour at the Park.  She declared them to be very agreeable girls
## 3920     indeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.  Sir John&#39;s
## 3921       confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise, and he
## 3922     set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss
## 3923      Steeles&#39; arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls
## 3924       in the world.  From such commendation as this, however, there was not
## 3925         much to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the
## 3926             world were to be met with in every part of England, under every
## 3927       possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding.  Sir John
## 3928        wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his
## 3929      guests.  Benevolent, philanthropic man!  It was painful to him even to
## 3930                                             keep a third cousin to himself.
## 3931                                                                            
## 3932      &quot;Do come now,&quot; said he--&quot;pray come--you must come--I declare you shall
## 3933            come--You can&#39;t think how you will like them.  Lucy is monstrous
## 3934           pretty, and so good humoured and agreeable!  The children are all
## 3935     hanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance.  And they
## 3936      both long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that
## 3937     you are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told them
## 3938     it is all very true, and a great deal more.  You will be delighted with
## 3939       them I am sure.  They have brought the whole coach full of playthings
## 3940        for the children.  How can you be so cross as not to come?  Why they
## 3941       are your cousins, you know, after a fashion.  YOU are my cousins, and
## 3942                                they are my wife&#39;s, so you must be related.&quot;
## 3943                                                                            
## 3944          But Sir John could not prevail.  He could only obtain a promise of
## 3945        their calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in
## 3946       amazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their
## 3947     attractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the
## 3948                                                       Miss Steeles to them.
## 3949                                                                            
## 3950        When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to
## 3951          these young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of the
## 3952         eldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensible
## 3953     face, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two or
## 3954       three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her features
## 3955         were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness of air,
## 3956     which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave distinction
## 3957     to her person.-- Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon
## 3958          allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw with what
## 3959      constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable
## 3960      to Lady Middleton.  With her children they were in continual raptures,
## 3961          extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their
## 3962       whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate
## 3963        demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of
## 3964     whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing,
## 3965               or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her
## 3966           appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.
## 3967      Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond
## 3968             mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most
## 3969      rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands
## 3970           are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive
## 3971      affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were
## 3972         viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or
## 3973            distrust.  She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent
## 3974        encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.
## 3975      She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their
## 3976     work-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt
## 3977        no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment.  It suggested no other
## 3978         surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,
## 3979                               without claiming a share in what was passing.
## 3980                                                                            
## 3981     &quot;John is in such spirits today!&quot; said she, on his taking Miss Steeles&#39;s
## 3982          pocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window--&quot;He is full of
## 3983                                                             monkey tricks.&quot;
## 3984                                                                            
## 3985      And soon afterwards, on the second boy&#39;s violently pinching one of the
## 3986         same lady&#39;s fingers, she fondly observed, &quot;How playful William is!&quot;
## 3987                                                                            
## 3988      &quot;And here is my sweet little Annamaria,&quot; she added, tenderly caressing
## 3989     a little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the last
## 3990        two minutes; &quot;And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was there
## 3991                                                 such a quiet little thing!&quot;
## 3992                                                                            
## 3993      But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship&#39;s
## 3994         head dress slightly scratching the child&#39;s neck, produced from this
## 3995      pattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone
## 3996          by any creature professedly noisy.  The mother&#39;s consternation was
## 3997      excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and
## 3998       every thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which
## 3999      affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little
## 4000     sufferer.  She was seated in her mother&#39;s lap, covered with kisses, her
## 4001       wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was
## 4002       on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by
## 4003     the other.  With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise to
## 4004        cease crying.  She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two
## 4005     brothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings were
## 4006      ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of
## 4007                 similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been
## 4008      successfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly
## 4009         proposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of
## 4010      screams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that
## 4011       it would not be rejected.-- She was carried out of the room therefore
## 4012        in her mother&#39;s arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys
## 4013         chose to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay
## 4014       behind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room
## 4015                                               had not known for many hours.
## 4016                                                                            
## 4017       &quot;Poor little creatures!&quot; said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone.
## 4018                                   &quot;It might have been a very sad accident.&quot;
## 4019                                                                            
## 4020          &quot;Yet I hardly know how,&quot; cried Marianne, &quot;unless it had been under
## 4021              totally different circumstances.  But this is the usual way of
## 4022     heightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality.&quot;
## 4023                                                                            
## 4024                   &quot;What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!&quot; said Lucy Steele.
## 4025                                                                            
## 4026      Marianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say what she did not
## 4027     feel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the whole
## 4028     task of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell.  She did
## 4029       her best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton with more
## 4030                  warmth than she felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy.
## 4031                                                                            
## 4032    &quot;And Sir John too,&quot; cried the elder sister, &quot;what a charming man he is!&quot;
## 4033                                                                            
## 4034         Here too, Miss Dashwood&#39;s commendation, being only simple and just,
## 4035       came in without any eclat.  She merely observed that he was perfectly
## 4036                                                 good humoured and friendly.
## 4037                                                                            
## 4038        &quot;And what a charming little family they have!  I never saw such fine
## 4039         children in my life.--I declare I quite doat upon them already, and
## 4040                          indeed I am always distractedly fond of children.&quot;
## 4041                                                                            
## 4042           &quot;I should guess so,&quot; said Elinor, with a smile, &quot;from what I have
## 4043                                                    witnessed this morning.&quot;
## 4044                                                                            
## 4045       &quot;I have a notion,&quot; said Lucy, &quot;you think the little Middletons rather
## 4046     too much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it is
## 4047       so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see children
## 4048           full of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and
## 4049                                                                     quiet.&quot;
## 4050                                                                            
## 4051       &quot;I confess,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;that while I am at Barton Park, I never
## 4052                      think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence.&quot;
## 4053                                                                            
## 4054         A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss
## 4055         Steele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now
## 4056       said rather abruptly, &quot;And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?
## 4057                             I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex.&quot;
## 4058                                                                            
## 4059        In some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least of
## 4060             the manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she was.
## 4061                                                                            
## 4062    &quot;Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?&quot; added Miss Steele.
## 4063                                                                            
## 4064       &quot;We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,&quot; said Lucy, who seemed
## 4065              to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister.
## 4066                                                                            
## 4067       &quot;I think every one MUST admire it,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;who ever saw the
## 4068        place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its
## 4069                                                         beauties as we do.&quot;
## 4070                                                                            
## 4071     &quot;And had you a great many smart beaux there?  I suppose you have not so
## 4072        many in this part of the world; for my part, I think they are a vast
## 4073                                                           addition always.&quot;
## 4074                                                                            
## 4075       &quot;But why should you think,&quot; said Lucy, looking ashamed of her sister,
## 4076     &quot;that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex?&quot;
## 4077                                                                            
## 4078        &quot;Nay, my dear, I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t pretend to say that there an&#39;t.  I&#39;m
## 4079     sure there&#39;s a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how could
## 4080        I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was only
## 4081     afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not
## 4082         so many as they used to have.  But perhaps you young ladies may not
## 4083         care about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with them.
## 4084         For my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they dress
## 4085      smart and behave civil.  But I can&#39;t bear to see them dirty and nasty.
## 4086       Now there&#39;s Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man, quite a
## 4087     beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but meet him of
## 4088     a morning, he is not fit to be seen.-- I suppose your brother was quite
## 4089               a beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was so rich?&quot;
## 4090                                                                            
## 4091            &quot;Upon my word,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;I cannot tell you, for I do not
## 4092     perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.  But this I can say, that
## 4093       if he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is
## 4094                                        not the smallest alteration in him.&quot;
## 4095                                                                            
## 4096         &quot;Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men&#39;s being beaux--they have
## 4097                                                      something else to do.&quot;
## 4098                                                                            
## 4099                &quot;Lord! Anne,&quot; cried her sister, &quot;you can talk of nothing but
## 4100     beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else.&quot;
## 4101        And then to turn the discourse, she began admiring the house and the
## 4102                                                                  furniture.
## 4103                                                                            
## 4104       This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough.  The vulgar freedom and
## 4105       folly of the eldest left her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not
## 4106      blinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her want
## 4107       of real elegance and artlessness, she left the house without any wish
## 4108                                                     of knowing them better.
## 4109                                                                            
## 4110         Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter, well provided with
## 4111       admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his family, and all his
## 4112        relations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair
## 4113              cousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant,
## 4114       accomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom
## 4115         they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.-- And to be
## 4116         better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitable
## 4117          lot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles,
## 4118            their party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind of
## 4119     intimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or two
## 4120     together in the same room almost every day.  Sir John could do no more;
## 4121      but he did not know that any more was required: to be together was, in
## 4122      his opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their
## 4123       meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being established
## 4124                                                                    friends.
## 4125                                                                            
## 4126         To do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote their
## 4127      unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew
## 4128                 or supposed of his cousins&#39; situations in the most delicate
## 4129      particulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the
## 4130       eldest of them wished her joy on her sister&#39;s having been so lucky as
## 4131           to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton.
## 4132                                                                            
## 4133      &quot;&#39;Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure,&quot; said
## 4134        she, &quot;and I hear he is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome.  And I
## 4135     hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have
## 4136                                            a friend in the corner already.&quot;
## 4137                                                                            
## 4138                Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in
## 4139       proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he had been
## 4140        with respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of
## 4141            the two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and since
## 4142       Edward&#39;s visit, they had never dined together without his drinking to
## 4143          her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and
## 4144     winks, as to excite general attention.  The letter F--had been likewise
## 4145          invariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless
## 4146        jokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had
## 4147                                          been long established with Elinor.
## 4148                                                                            
## 4149         The Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit of these
## 4150        jokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the
## 4151         name of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinently
## 4152        expressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness
## 4153         into the concerns of their family.  But Sir John did not sport long
## 4154      with the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least as
## 4155        much pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it.
## 4156                                                                            
## 4157     &quot;His name is Ferrars,&quot; said he, in a very audible whisper; &quot;but pray do
## 4158                                      not tell it, for it&#39;s a great secret.&quot;
## 4159                                                                            
## 4160      &quot;Ferrars!&quot; repeated Miss Steele; &quot;Mr. Ferrars is the happy man, is he?
## 4161         What! your sister-in-law&#39;s brother, Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable
## 4162                                young man to be sure; I know him very well.&quot;
## 4163                                                                            
## 4164     &quot;How can you say so, Anne?&quot; cried Lucy, who generally made an amendment
## 4165     to all her sister&#39;s assertions.  &quot;Though we have seen him once or twice
## 4166     at my uncle&#39;s, it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well.&quot;
## 4167                                                                            
## 4168       Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise.  &quot;And who was this
## 4169     uncle?  Where did he live?  How came they acquainted?&quot;  She wished very
## 4170     much to have the subject continued, though she did not chuse to join in
## 4171      it herself; but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time in
## 4172     her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity after
## 4173       petty information, or in a disposition to communicate it.  The manner
## 4174     in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; for
## 4175      it struck her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion
## 4176        of that lady&#39;s knowing, or fancying herself to know something to his
## 4177      disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing, for no farther notice
## 4178     was taken of Mr. Ferrars&#39;s name by Miss Steele when alluded to, or even
## 4179                                               openly mentioned by Sir John.
## 4180                                                                            
## 4181                                                                            
## 4182                                                                            
## 4183                                                                  CHAPTER 22
## 4184                                                                            
## 4185                                                                            
## 4186                  Marianne, who had never much toleration for any thing like
## 4187        impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of
## 4188        taste from herself, was at this time particularly ill-disposed, from
## 4189        the state of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, or to
## 4190             encourage their advances; and to the invariable coldness of her
## 4191        behaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy on
## 4192        their side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself
## 4193         which soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially of
## 4194      Lucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation, or of
## 4195                 striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank
## 4196                                            communication of her sentiments.
## 4197                                                                            
## 4198     Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often just and amusing; and
## 4199      as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable;
## 4200     but her powers had received no aid from education: she was ignorant and
## 4201       illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement, her want of
## 4202     information in the most common particulars, could not be concealed from
## 4203              Miss Dashwood, in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to
## 4204        advantage.  Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities
## 4205       which education might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with
## 4206               less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, of
## 4207                 rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, her
## 4208     assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have no
## 4209      lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity
## 4210        with ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in
## 4211     conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward others made
## 4212             every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly
## 4213                                                                  valueless.
## 4214                                                                            
## 4215       &quot;You will think my question an odd one, I dare say,&quot; said Lucy to her
## 4216                 one day, as they were walking together from the park to the
## 4217                 cottage--&quot;but pray, are you personally acquainted with your
## 4218                                      sister-in-law&#39;s mother, Mrs. Ferrars?&quot;
## 4219                                                                            
## 4220           Elinor DID think the question a very odd one, and her countenance
## 4221         expressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.
## 4222                                                                            
## 4223      &quot;Indeed!&quot; replied Lucy; &quot;I wonder at that, for I thought you must have
## 4224      seen her at Norland sometimes.  Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what
## 4225                                                    sort of a woman she is?&quot;
## 4226                                                                            
## 4227      &quot;No,&quot; returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward&#39;s
## 4228         mother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent
## 4229                                        curiosity-- &quot;I know nothing of her.&quot;
## 4230                                                                            
## 4231     &quot;I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such a
## 4232       way,&quot; said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke; &quot;but perhaps
## 4233        there may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I hope you
## 4234                will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be
## 4235                                                               impertinent.&quot;
## 4236                                                                            
## 4237      Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in
## 4238           silence.  It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again by
## 4239                                               saying, with some hesitation,
## 4240                                                                            
## 4241     &quot;I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious.  I am sure I
## 4242       would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person
## 4243       whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours.  And I am sure I
## 4244      should not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should be
## 4245             very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable
## 4246       situation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU.
## 4247                         I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.&quot;
## 4248                                                                            
## 4249     &quot;I am sorry I do NOT,&quot; said Elinor, in great astonishment, &quot;if it could
## 4250         be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her.  But really I never
## 4251             understood that you were at all connected with that family, and
## 4252      therefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry
## 4253                                                        into her character.&quot;
## 4254                                                                            
## 4255       &quot;I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it.  But
## 4256          if I dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised.  Mrs.
## 4257             Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present--but the time MAY
## 4258        come--how soon it will come must depend upon herself--when we may be
## 4259                                                 very intimately connected.&quot;
## 4260                                                                            
## 4261       She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful, with only one side
## 4262                       glance at her companion to observe its effect on her.
## 4263                                                                            
## 4264        &quot;Good heavens!&quot; cried Elinor, &quot;what do you mean?  Are you acquainted
## 4265            with Mr. Robert Ferrars?  Can you be?&quot; And she did not feel much
## 4266                            delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law.
## 4267                                                                            
## 4268       &quot;No,&quot; replied Lucy, &quot;not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I never saw him in my
## 4269           life; but,&quot; fixing her eyes upon Elinor, &quot;to his eldest brother.&quot;
## 4270                                                                            
## 4271      What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been as
## 4272             painful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the
## 4273        assertion attended it.  She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,
## 4274     unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and though
## 4275        her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt in no
## 4276                                    danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.
## 4277                                                                            
## 4278      &quot;You may well be surprised,&quot; continued Lucy; &quot;for to be sure you could
## 4279          have had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped the
## 4280     smallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was always
## 4281       meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully kept so
## 4282          by me to this hour.  Not a soul of all my relations know of it but
## 4283        Anne, and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not felt
## 4284        the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I really
## 4285         thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars
## 4286        must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.  And I do not think
## 4287            Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted you,
## 4288          because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your
## 4289       family, and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as
## 4290                                              his own sisters.&quot;--She paused.
## 4291                                                                            
## 4292     Elinor for a few moments remained silent.  Her astonishment at what she
## 4293       heard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself
## 4294       to speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,
## 4295     which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude-- &quot;May I ask
## 4296                                    if your engagement is of long standing?&quot;
## 4297                                                                            
## 4298                                    &quot;We have been engaged these four years.&quot;
## 4299                                                                            
## 4300                                                               &quot;Four years!&quot;
## 4301                                                                            
## 4302                                                                      &quot;Yes.&quot;
## 4303                                                                            
## 4304            Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it.
## 4305                                                                            
## 4306         &quot;I did not know,&quot; said she, &quot;that you were even acquainted till the
## 4307                                                                 other day.&quot;
## 4308                                                                            
## 4309         &quot;Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date.  He was under my
## 4310                              uncle&#39;s care, you know, a considerable while.&quot;
## 4311                                                                            
## 4312                                                               &quot;Your uncle!&quot;
## 4313                                                                            
## 4314                &quot;Yes; Mr. Pratt.  Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?&quot;
## 4315                                                                            
## 4316        &quot;I think I have,&quot; replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which
## 4317                                     increased with her increase of emotion.
## 4318                                                                            
## 4319             &quot;He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near
## 4320        Plymouth.  It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me
## 4321        was often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was
## 4322      formed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he
## 4323        was almost always with us afterwards.  I was very unwilling to enter
## 4324       into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of
## 4325           his mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so
## 4326       prudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him so well
## 4327       as me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible
## 4328            he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.&quot;
## 4329                                                                            
## 4330      &quot;Certainly,&quot; answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but after
## 4331         a moment&#39;s reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward&#39;s
## 4332      honour and love, and her companion&#39;s falsehood--&quot;Engaged to Mr. Edward
## 4333        Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,
## 4334       that really--I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake
## 4335                   of person or name.  We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.&quot;
## 4336                                                                            
## 4337      &quot;We can mean no other,&quot; cried Lucy, smiling.  &quot;Mr. Edward Ferrars, the
## 4338             eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your
## 4339     sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must allow
## 4340        that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who
## 4341                                                  all my happiness depends.&quot;
## 4342                                                                            
## 4343      &quot;It is strange,&quot; replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, &quot;that I
## 4344                        should never have heard him even mention your name.&quot;
## 4345                                                                            
## 4346     &quot;No; considering our situation, it was not strange.  Our first care has
## 4347     been to keep the matter secret.-- You knew nothing of me, or my family,
## 4348      and, therefore, there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name
## 4349           to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister&#39;s
## 4350    suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it.&quot;
## 4351                                                                            
## 4352       She was silent.--Elinor&#39;s security sunk; but her self-command did not
## 4353                                                               sink with it.
## 4354                                                                            
## 4355             &quot;Four years you have been engaged,&quot; said she with a firm voice.
## 4356                                                                            
## 4357           &quot;Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait.  Poor
## 4358     Edward!  It puts him quite out of heart.&quot; Then taking a small miniature
## 4359      from her pocket, she added, &quot;To prevent the possibility of mistake, be
## 4360         so good as to look at this face.  It does not do him justice, to be
## 4361        sure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was
## 4362                          drew for.--I have had it above these three years.&quot;
## 4363                                                                            
## 4364             She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor saw the
## 4365        painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, or
## 4366     her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind, she
## 4367         could have none of its being Edward&#39;s face.  She returned it almost
## 4368                                      instantly, acknowledging the likeness.
## 4369                                                                            
## 4370        &quot;I have never been able,&quot; continued Lucy, &quot;to give him my picture in
## 4371            return, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so
## 4372        anxious to get it!  But I am determined to set for it the very first
## 4373                                                               opportunity.&quot;
## 4374                                                                            
## 4375             &quot;You are quite in the right,&quot; replied Elinor calmly.  They then
## 4376                        proceeded a few paces in silence.  Lucy spoke first.
## 4377                                                                            
## 4378     &quot;I am sure,&quot; said she, &quot;I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully
## 4379      keeping this secret, because you must know of what importance it is to
## 4380     us, not to have it reach his mother; for she would never approve of it,
## 4381       I dare say.  I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding
## 4382                                                               proud woman.&quot;
## 4383                                                                            
## 4384     &quot;I certainly did not seek your confidence,&quot; said Elinor; &quot;but you do me
## 4385          no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on.  Your
## 4386      secret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so
## 4387     unnecessary a communication.  You must at least have felt that my being
## 4388                            acquainted with it could not add to its safety.&quot;
## 4389                                                                            
## 4390          As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover
## 4391         something in her countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest
## 4392        part of what she had been saying; but Lucy&#39;s countenance suffered no
## 4393                                                                     change.
## 4394                                                                            
## 4395       &quot;I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,&quot;
## 4396        said she, &quot;in telling you all this.  I have not known you long to be
## 4397      sure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by
## 4398       description a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as
## 4399      if you was an old acquaintance.  Besides in the present case, I really
## 4400     thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular
## 4401       inquiries about Edward&#39;s mother; and I am so unfortunate, that I have
## 4402        not a creature whose advice I can ask.  Anne is the only person that
## 4403          knows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a
## 4404            great deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her
## 4405        betraying me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you must
## 4406           perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world
## 4407         t&#39;other day, when Edward&#39;s name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she
## 4408        should out with it all.  You can&#39;t think how much I go through in my
## 4409        mind from it altogether.  I only wonder that I am alive after what I
## 4410      have suffered for Edward&#39;s sake these last four years.  Every thing in
## 4411      such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom--we can hardly
## 4412          meet above twice a-year.  I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite
## 4413                                                                     broke.&quot;
## 4414                                                                            
## 4415            Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very
## 4416                                                              compassionate.
## 4417                                                                            
## 4418     &quot;Sometimes.&quot; continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, &quot;I think whether it
## 4419      would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely.&quot;  As
## 4420          she said this, she looked directly at her companion.  &quot;But then at
## 4421        other times I have not resolution enough for it.-- I cannot bear the
## 4422     thoughts of making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of such
## 4423     a thing would do.  And on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--I
## 4424      don&#39;t think I could be equal to it.  What would you advise me to do in
## 4425                   such a case, Miss Dashwood?  What would you do yourself?&quot;
## 4426                                                                            
## 4427      &quot;Pardon me,&quot; replied Elinor, startled by the question; &quot;but I can give
## 4428      you no advice under such circumstances.  Your own judgment must direct
## 4429                                                                       you.&quot;
## 4430                                                                            
## 4431           &quot;To be sure,&quot; continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both
## 4432         sides, &quot;his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poor
## 4433               Edward is so cast down by it!  Did you not think him dreadful
## 4434       low-spirited when he was at Barton?  He was so miserable when he left
## 4435       us at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him
## 4436                                                                 quite ill.&quot;
## 4437                                                                            
## 4438                  &quot;Did he come from your uncle&#39;s, then, when he visited us?&quot;
## 4439                                                                            
## 4440        &quot;Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us.  Did you think he
## 4441                                                   came directly from town?&quot;
## 4442                                                                            
## 4443                &quot;No,&quot; replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh
## 4444     circumstance in favour of Lucy&#39;s veracity; &quot;I remember he told us, that
## 4445       he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.&quot; She
## 4446     remembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning nothing
## 4447         farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect even to
## 4448                                                                their names.
## 4449                                                                            
## 4450                &quot;Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?&quot; repeated Lucy.
## 4451                                                                            
## 4452                    &quot;We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.&quot;
## 4453                                                                            
## 4454     &quot;I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the
## 4455     matter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more than
## 4456      a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--I
## 4457       am afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes in wretched
## 4458      spirits.  I heard from him just before I left Exeter;&quot; taking a letter
## 4459       from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.  &quot;You
## 4460            know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is; but that is not
## 4461        written so well as usual.--He was tired, I dare say, for he had just
## 4462                                filled the sheet to me as full as possible.&quot;
## 4463                                                                            
## 4464       Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt no longer.  This
## 4465                picture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been
## 4466          accidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward&#39;s gift; but a
## 4467           correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a
## 4468         positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few
## 4469        moments, she was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she
## 4470       could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she
## 4471        struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that
## 4472                          her success was speedy, and for the time complete.
## 4473                                                                            
## 4474           &quot;Writing to each other,&quot; said Lucy, returning the letter into her
## 4475      pocket, &quot;is the only comfort we have in such long separations.  Yes, I
## 4476         have one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not even
## 4477     THAT.  If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.  I gave him
## 4478         a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last, and
## 4479          that was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture.
## 4480                        Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?&quot;
## 4481                                                                            
## 4482            &quot;I did,&quot; said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which was
## 4483        concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt
## 4484                            before.  She was mortified, shocked, confounded.
## 4485                                                                            
## 4486              Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and the
## 4487      conversation could be continued no farther.  After sitting with them a
## 4488     few minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was then
## 4489                                        at liberty to think and be wretched.
## 4490

## 4504      However small Elinor&#39;s general dependence on Lucy&#39;s veracity might be,
## 4505        it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the
## 4506       present case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of
## 4507     inventing a falsehood of such a description.  What Lucy had asserted to
## 4508     be true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt; supported
## 4509           as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, and
## 4510           contradicted by nothing but her own wishes.  Their opportunity of
## 4511       acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest,
## 4512        at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward&#39;s visit near Plymouth,
## 4513     his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own prospects,
## 4514      his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the
## 4515          Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which had
## 4516              often surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formed
## 4517               altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear of
## 4518     condemning him unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partiality
## 4519      could set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.--Her resentment of such
## 4520        behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time
## 4521      made her feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations,
## 4522           soon arose.  Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?  Had he
## 4523      feigned a regard for her which he did not feel?  Was his engagement to
## 4524     Lucy an engagement of the heart?  No; whatever it might once have been,
## 4525        she could not believe it such at present.  His affection was all her
## 4526       own.  She could not be deceived in that.  Her mother, sisters, Fanny,
## 4527      all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not an
## 4528       illusion of her own vanity.  He certainly loved her.  What a softener
## 4529       of the heart was this persuasion!  How much could it not tempt her to
## 4530            forgive!  He had been blamable, highly blamable, in remaining at
## 4531       Norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it
## 4532      ought to be.  In that, he could not be defended; but if he had injured
## 4533       her, how much more had he injured himself; if her case were pitiable,
## 4534       his was hopeless.  His imprudence had made her miserable for a while;
## 4535          but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being
## 4536      otherwise.  She might in time regain tranquillity; but HE, what had he
## 4537     to look forward to?  Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele;
## 4538      could he, were his affection for herself out of the question, with his
## 4539        integrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a
## 4540                             wife like her--illiterate, artful, and selfish?
## 4541                                                                            
## 4542     The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every
## 4543               thing but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding
## 4544       years--years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the
## 4545       understanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education,
## 4546        while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society
## 4547      and more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity
## 4548         which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty.
## 4549                                                                            
## 4550     If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his difficulties
## 4551     from his mother had seemed great, how much greater were they now likely
## 4552        to be, when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in
## 4553            connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.  These
## 4554        difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Lucy, might not
## 4555      press very hard upon his patience; but melancholy was the state of the
## 4556         person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness,
## 4557                                                  could be felt as a relief!
## 4558                                                                            
## 4559     As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she wept
## 4560      for him, more than for herself.  Supported by the conviction of having
## 4561          done nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the
## 4562      belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she thought
## 4563        she could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, command
## 4564        herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother
## 4565      and sisters.  And so well was she able to answer her own expectations,
## 4566      that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first
## 4567         suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one would have
## 4568       supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning
## 4569     in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object
## 4570               of her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the
## 4571              perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly
## 4572       possessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove
## 4573                                                           near their house.
## 4574                                                                            
## 4575     The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had been
## 4576      entrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to unceasing
## 4577      exertion, was no aggravation of Elinor&#39;s distress.  On the contrary it
## 4578      was a relief to her, to be spared the communication of what would give
## 4579         such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing that
## 4580        condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess of
## 4581       their partial affection for herself, and which was more than she felt
## 4582                                                           equal to support.
## 4583                                                                            
## 4584       From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receive
## 4585        no assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress,
## 4586       while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their
## 4587         example nor from their praise.  She was stronger alone, and her own
## 4588        good sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken,
## 4589            her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so
## 4590                      poignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.
## 4591                                                                            
## 4592       Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the
## 4593         subject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for
## 4594        more reasons than one.  She wanted to hear many particulars of their
## 4595       engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what
## 4596        Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her
## 4597        declaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to
## 4598       convince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her
## 4599       calmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in
## 4600             it than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary
## 4601              agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least
## 4602        doubtful.  That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very
## 4603          probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her
## 4604         praise, not merely from Lucy&#39;s assertion, but from her venturing to
## 4605             trust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so
## 4606            confessedly and evidently important.  And even Sir John&#39;s joking
## 4607           intelligence must have had some weight.  But indeed, while Elinor
## 4608          remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by
## 4609      Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it
## 4610          natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very
## 4611        confidence was a proof.  What other reason for the disclosure of the
## 4612           affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of
## 4613     Lucy&#39;s superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future?
## 4614         She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival&#39;s
## 4615        intentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every
## 4616       principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own affection
## 4617         for Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny
## 4618     herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was
## 4619       unwounded.  And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on
## 4620        the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her own
## 4621        ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure.
## 4622                                                                            
## 4623         But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be
## 4624              commanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take
## 4625          advantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fine
## 4626           enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most
## 4627          easily separate themselves from the others; and though they met at
## 4628     least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly at
## 4629              the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of
## 4630     conversation.  Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady
## 4631      Middleton&#39;s head; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for
## 4632     a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse.  They met for
## 4633      the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,
## 4634             or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.
## 4635                                                                            
## 4636         One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording
## 4637      Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at
## 4638          the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they
## 4639           would all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged to
## 4640          attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone,
## 4641          except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.  Elinor, who foresaw a
## 4642       fairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this
## 4643       was likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil
## 4644      and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united
## 4645                them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the
## 4646             invitation; Margaret, with her mother&#39;s permission, was equally
## 4647       compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their
## 4648        parties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her
## 4649               seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.
## 4650                                                                            
## 4651        The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from
## 4652     the frightful solitude which had threatened her.  The insipidity of the
## 4653        meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one
## 4654     novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interesting
## 4655            than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and
## 4656       drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and while
## 4657     they remained there, she was too well convinced of the impossibility of
## 4658     engaging Lucy&#39;s attention to attempt it.  They quitted it only with the
## 4659      removal of the tea-things.  The card-table was then placed, and Elinor
## 4660            began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of
## 4661             finding time for conversation at the park.  They all rose up in
## 4662                                               preparation for a round game.
## 4663                                                                            
## 4664      &quot;I am glad,&quot; said Lady Middleton to Lucy, &quot;you are not going to finish
## 4665     poor little Annamaria&#39;s basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt
## 4666       your eyes to work filigree by candlelight.  And we will make the dear
## 4667        little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and then I
## 4668                                            hope she will not much mind it.&quot;
## 4669                                                                            
## 4670       This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied,
## 4671       &quot;Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waiting
## 4672        to know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have
## 4673       been at my filigree already.  I would not disappoint the little angel
## 4674           for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I am
## 4675                                resolved to finish the basket after supper.&quot;
## 4676                                                                            
## 4677       &quot;You are very good, I hope it won&#39;t hurt your eyes--will you ring the
## 4678          bell for some working candles?  My poor little girl would be sadly
## 4679          disappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for
## 4680        though I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon
## 4681                                                            having it done.&quot;
## 4682                                                                            
## 4683     Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an
## 4684     alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no
## 4685        greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.
## 4686                                                                            
## 4687      Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others.  No one made
## 4688     any objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the forms
## 4689       of general civility, exclaimed, &quot;Your Ladyship will have the goodness
## 4690      to excuse ME--you know I detest cards.  I shall go to the piano-forte;
## 4691             I have not touched it since it was tuned.&quot;  And without farther
## 4692                     ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.
## 4693                                                                            
## 4694      Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that SHE had never made
## 4695                                                           so rude a speech.
## 4696                                                                            
## 4697        &quot;Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma&#39;am,&quot;
## 4698         said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; &quot;and I do not
## 4699         much wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever
## 4700                                                                     heard.&quot;
## 4701                                                                            
## 4702                            The remaining five were now to draw their cards.
## 4703                                                                            
## 4704       &quot;Perhaps,&quot; continued Elinor, &quot;if I should happen to cut out, I may be
## 4705         of some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; and
## 4706            there is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be
## 4707     impossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening.  I
## 4708     should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in it.&quot;
## 4709                                                                            
## 4710     &quot;Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help,&quot; cried Lucy,
## 4711        &quot;for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was;
## 4712         and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after
## 4713                                                                       all.&quot;
## 4714                                                                            
## 4715       &quot;Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,&quot; said Miss Steele-- &quot;Dear little
## 4716                                                   soul, how I do love her!&quot;
## 4717                                                                            
## 4718      &quot;You are very kind,&quot; said Lady Middleton to Elinor; &quot;and as you really
## 4719       like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till
## 4720                          another rubber, or will you take your chance now?&quot;
## 4721                                                                            
## 4722     Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by a
## 4723             little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to
## 4724        practise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same
## 4725        time.  Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fair
## 4726       rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the
## 4727     utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.  The pianoforte at
## 4728       which Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, had
## 4729       by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,
## 4730            was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might
## 4731           safely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting
## 4732                 subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.
## 4733                                                                            
## 4734                                                                            
## 4735                                                                            
## 4736                                                                  CHAPTER 24
## 4737                                                                            
## 4738                                                                            
## 4739                         In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.
## 4740                                                                            
## 4741       &quot;I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with,
## 4742     if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on its
## 4743    subject.  I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.&quot;
## 4744                                                                            
## 4745      &quot;Thank you,&quot; cried Lucy warmly, &quot;for breaking the ice; you have set my
## 4746       heart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended
## 4747                                        you by what I told you that Monday.&quot;
## 4748                                                                            
## 4749       &quot;Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,&quot; and Elinor spoke
## 4750             it with the truest sincerity, &quot;nothing could be farther from my
## 4751       intention than to give you such an idea.  Could you have a motive for
## 4752                   the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?&quot;
## 4753                                                                            
## 4754      &quot;And yet I do assure you,&quot; replied Lucy, her little sharp eyes full of
## 4755       meaning, &quot;there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your
## 4756          manner that made me quite uncomfortable.  I felt sure that you was
## 4757        angry with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for
## 4758     having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs.  But I am
## 4759      very glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not
## 4760        blame me.  If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my
## 4761       heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of
## 4762      my life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am
## 4763                                                                      sure.&quot;
## 4764                                                                            
## 4765       &quot;Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you,
## 4766          to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall
## 4767       never have reason to repent it.  Your case is a very unfortunate one;
## 4768        you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have
## 4769           need of all your mutual affection to support you under them.  Mr.
## 4770                   Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.&quot;
## 4771                                                                            
## 4772         &quot;He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to
## 4773     marry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospect
## 4774            of more without a sigh.  I have been always used to a very small
## 4775     income, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too
## 4776       well to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that his
## 4777        mother might give him if he married to please her.  We must wait, it
## 4778        may be for many years.  With almost every other man in the world, it
## 4779         would be an alarming prospect; but Edward&#39;s affection and constancy
## 4780                                          nothing can deprive me of I know.&quot;
## 4781                                                                            
## 4782          &quot;That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedly
## 4783             supported by the same trust in your&#39;s.  If the strength of your
## 4784         reciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and under
## 4785      many circumstances it naturally would during a four years&#39; engagement,
## 4786                           your situation would have been pitiable, indeed.&quot;
## 4787                                                                            
## 4788     Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her countenance
## 4789      from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency.
## 4790                                                                            
## 4791         &quot;Edward&#39;s love for me,&quot; said Lucy, &quot;has been pretty well put to the
## 4792       test, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, and
## 4793      it has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt
## 4794      it now.  I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment&#39;s alarm
## 4795                                            on that account from the first.&quot;
## 4796                                                                            
## 4797              Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion.
## 4798                                                                            
## 4799     Lucy went on.  &quot;I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and from
## 4800        our different situations in life, from his being so much more in the
## 4801      world than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined for
## 4802     suspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been
## 4803         the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or any
## 4804        lowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had talked
## 4805       more of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less happy at
## 4806              Longstaple than he used to be.  I do not mean to say that I am
## 4807      particularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case
## 4808                                         I am sure I could not be deceived.&quot;
## 4809                                                                            
## 4810         &quot;All this,&quot; thought Elinor, &quot;is very pretty; but it can impose upon
## 4811                                                             neither of us.&quot;
## 4812                                                                            
## 4813        &quot;But what,&quot; said she after a short silence, &quot;are your views? or have
## 4814           you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s death, which is a
## 4815      melancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to
## 4816     this, and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which
## 4817       it may involve you, rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a
## 4818                                                 while by owning the truth?&quot;
## 4819                                                                            
## 4820        &quot;If we could be certain that it would be only for a while!  But Mrs.
## 4821     Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her first fit of anger
## 4822        upon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert, and
## 4823      the idea of that, for Edward&#39;s sake, frightens away all my inclination
## 4824                                                        for hasty measures.&quot;
## 4825                                                                            
## 4826      &quot;And for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestedness
## 4827                                                             beyond reason.&quot;
## 4828                                                                            
## 4829                                Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.
## 4830                                                                            
## 4831                             &quot;Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?&quot; asked Elinor.
## 4832                                                                            
## 4833             &quot;Not at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he is very unlike his
## 4834                                        brother--silly and a great coxcomb.&quot;
## 4835                                                                            
## 4836         &quot;A great coxcomb!&quot; repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had caught those
## 4837     words by a sudden pause in Marianne&#39;s music.-- &quot;Oh, they are talking of
## 4838                                         their favourite beaux, I dare say.&quot;
## 4839                                                                            
## 4840       &quot;No sister,&quot; cried Lucy, &quot;you are mistaken there, our favourite beaux
## 4841                                                    are NOT great coxcombs.&quot;
## 4842                                                                            
## 4843      &quot;I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood&#39;s is not,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings,
## 4844       laughing heartily; &quot;for he is one of the modestest, prettiest behaved
## 4845             young men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little
## 4846                           creature, there is no finding out who SHE likes.&quot;
## 4847                                                                            
## 4848       &quot;Oh,&quot; cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round at them, &quot;I dare
## 4849               say Lucy&#39;s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss
## 4850                                                                Dashwood&#39;s.&quot;
## 4851                                                                            
## 4852           Elinor blushed in spite of herself.  Lucy bit her lip, and looked
## 4853          angrily at her sister.  A mutual silence took place for some time.
## 4854      Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Marianne
## 4855          was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent
## 4856                                                                  concerto--
## 4857                                                                            
## 4858       &quot;I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my
## 4859       head, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you into
## 4860        the secret, for you are a party concerned.  I dare say you have seen
## 4861     enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other
## 4862         profession; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he
## 4863      can, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be kind
## 4864      enough to use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some regard
## 4865          to me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living;
## 4866        which I understand is a very good one, and the present incumbent not
## 4867         likely to live a great while.  That would be enough for us to marry
## 4868                  upon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest.&quot;
## 4869                                                                            
## 4870         &quot;I should always be happy,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;to show any mark of my
## 4871      esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my
## 4872         interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary?  He is
## 4873        brother to Mrs. John Dashwood--THAT must be recommendation enough to
## 4874                                                               her husband.&quot;
## 4875                                                                            
## 4876       &quot;But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward&#39;s going into
## 4877                                                                    orders.&quot;
## 4878                                                                            
## 4879              &quot;Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little.&quot;
## 4880                                                                            
## 4881     They were again silent for many minutes.  At length Lucy exclaimed with
## 4882                                                                a deep sigh,
## 4883                                                                            
## 4884      &quot;I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at
## 4885      once by dissolving the engagement.  We seem so beset with difficulties
## 4886        on every side, that though it would make us miserable for a time, we
## 4887        should be happier perhaps in the end.  But you will not give me your
## 4888                                                     advice, Miss Dashwood?&quot;
## 4889                                                                            
## 4890          &quot;No,&quot; answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitated
## 4891      feelings, &quot;on such a subject I certainly will not.  You know very well
## 4892        that my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the
## 4893                                                       side of your wishes.&quot;
## 4894                                                                            
## 4895          &quot;Indeed you wrong me,&quot; replied Lucy, with great solemnity; &quot;I know
## 4896       nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours; and I do
## 4897          really believe, that if you was to say to me, &#39;I advise you by all
## 4898      means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will be
## 4899      more for the happiness of both of you,&#39; I should resolve upon doing it
## 4900                                                               immediately.&quot;
## 4901                                                                            
## 4902             Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward&#39;s future wife, and
## 4903     replied, &quot;This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any
## 4904       opinion on the subject had I formed one.  It raises my influence much
## 4905      too high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too
## 4906                                            much for an indifferent person.&quot;
## 4907                                                                            
## 4908          &quot;&#39;Tis because you are an indifferent person,&quot; said Lucy, with some
## 4909            pique, and laying a particular stress on those words, &quot;that your
## 4910            judgment might justly have such weight with me.  If you could be
## 4911     supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your opinion
## 4912                                                 would not be worth having.&quot;
## 4913                                                                            
## 4914         Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this, lest they might
## 4915     provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve; and
## 4916     was even partly determined never to mention the subject again.  Another
## 4917       pause therefore of many minutes&#39; duration, succeeded this speech, and
## 4918                                         Lucy was still the first to end it.
## 4919                                                                            
## 4920        &quot;Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?&quot; said she with all
## 4921                                                her accustomary complacency.
## 4922                                                                            
## 4923                                                            &quot;Certainly not.&quot;
## 4924                                                                            
## 4925     &quot;I am sorry for that,&quot; returned the other, while her eyes brightened at
## 4926           the information, &quot;it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you
## 4927          there!  But I dare say you will go for all that.  To be sure, your
## 4928                           brother and sister will ask you to come to them.&quot;
## 4929                                                                            
## 4930         &quot;It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do.&quot;
## 4931                                                                            
## 4932          &quot;How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there.
## 4933       Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who
## 4934      have been wanting us to visit them these several years!  But I only go
## 4935     for the sake of seeing Edward.  He will be there in February, otherwise
## 4936             London would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it.&quot;
## 4937                                                                            
## 4938     Elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the first
## 4939      rubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore
## 4940      at an end, to which both of them submitted without any reluctance, for
## 4941        nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other
## 4942       less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to the card table
## 4943             with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without
## 4944        affection for the person who was to be his wife; but that he had not
## 4945         even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which sincere
## 4946       affection on HER side would have given, for self-interest alone could
## 4947       induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which she seemed so
## 4948                                         thoroughly aware that he was weary.
## 4949                                                                            
## 4950            From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and when
## 4951     entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it,
## 4952     and was particularly careful to inform her confidante, of her happiness
## 4953           whenever she received a letter from Edward, it was treated by the
## 4954         former with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility
## 4955      would allow; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which
## 4956                  Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.
## 4957                                                                            
## 4958      The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond
## 4959      what the first invitation implied.  Their favour increased; they could
## 4960      not be spared; Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite of
## 4961     their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of the
## 4962      absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately, which was
## 4963      in full force at the end of every week, they were prevailed on to stay
## 4964      nearly two months at the park, and to assist in the due celebration of
## 4965          that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private
## 4966                         balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance.
## 4967                                                                            
## 4968                                                                            
## 4969                                                                            
## 4970                                                                  CHAPTER 25
## 4971                                                                            
## 4972                                                                            
## 4973        Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of
## 4974     the year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not without
## 4975       a settled habitation of her own.  Since the death of her husband, who
## 4976         had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town, she had
## 4977          resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman
## 4978         Square.  Towards this home, she began on the approach of January to
## 4979               turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and very
## 4980     unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her.
## 4981     Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her sister, and the
## 4982     animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave
## 4983      a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she believed herself
## 4984     to be speaking their united inclinations.  The reason alleged was their
## 4985       determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the
## 4986           year.  Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise, and
## 4987                                        repeated her invitation immediately.
## 4988                                                                            
## 4989      &quot;Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I DO beg
## 4990      you will favour me with your company, for I&#39;ve quite set my heart upon
## 4991     it.  Don&#39;t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I shan&#39;t
## 4992     put myself at all out of my way for you.  It will only be sending Betty
## 4993      by the coach, and I hope I can afford THAT.  We three shall be able to
## 4994      go very well in my chaise; and when we are in town, if you do not like
## 4995        to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always go with one of my
## 4996     daughters.  I am sure your mother will not object to it; for I have had
## 4997        such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will
## 4998        think me a very fit person to have the charge of you; and if I don&#39;t
## 4999        get one of you at least well married before I have done with you, it
## 5000        shall not be my fault.  I shall speak a good word for you to all the
## 5001                                         young men, you may depend upon it.&quot;
## 5002                                                                            
## 5003      &quot;I have a notion,&quot; said Sir John, &quot;that Miss Marianne would not object
## 5004       to such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it.  It is very
## 5005        hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because Miss
## 5006       Dashwood does not wish it.  So I would advise you two, to set off for
## 5007           town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to Miss
## 5008                                                         Dashwood about it.&quot;
## 5009                                                                            
## 5010         &quot;Nay,&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings, &quot;I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of
## 5011     Miss Marianne&#39;s company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only the
## 5012      more the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable for
## 5013      them to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk
## 5014        to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back.  But one or
## 5015     the other, if not both of them, I must have.  Lord bless me! how do you
## 5016         think I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used till
## 5017         this winter to have Charlotte with me.  Come, Miss Marianne, let us
## 5018         strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her
## 5019                                   mind by and bye, why so much the better.&quot;
## 5020                                                                            
## 5021      &quot;I thank you, ma&#39;am, sincerely thank you,&quot; said Marianne, with warmth:
## 5022       &quot;your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give
## 5023      me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of,
## 5024     to be able to accept it.  But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--I
## 5025       feel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be made
## 5026         less happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no, nothing should
## 5027             tempt me to leave her.  It should not, must not be a struggle.&quot;
## 5028                                                                            
## 5029         Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare
## 5030     them perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and saw
## 5031      to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her
## 5032               eagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct
## 5033              opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her mother&#39;s
## 5034            decision, from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any
## 5035            support in her endeavour to prevent a visit, which she could not
## 5036               approve of for Marianne, and which on her own account she had
## 5037        particular reasons to avoid.  Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her
## 5038     mother would be eager to promote--she could not expect to influence the
## 5039     latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had
## 5040     never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she dared not explain
## 5041             the motive of her own disinclination for going to London.  That
## 5042            Marianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs.
## 5043        Jennings&#39; manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook
## 5044         every inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be
## 5045      most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object,
## 5046      was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object
## 5047     to her, as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to
## 5048                                                                    witness.
## 5049                                                                            
## 5050     On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that such
## 5051              an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her
## 5052         daughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to
## 5053        herself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of
## 5054          their declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on their both
## 5055            accepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usual
## 5056        cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all,
## 5057                                                       from this separation.
## 5058                                                                            
## 5059      &quot;I am delighted with the plan,&quot; she cried, &quot;it is exactly what I could
## 5060       wish.  Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves.
## 5061         When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and
## 5062       happily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret
## 5063              so improved when you come back again!  I have a little plan of
## 5064        alteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without
## 5065       any inconvenience to any one.  It is very right that you SHOULD go to
## 5066              town; I would have every young woman of your condition in life
## 5067          acquainted with the manners and amusements of London.  You will be
## 5068       under the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to
## 5069          you I can have no doubt.  And in all probability you will see your
## 5070         brother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,
## 5071        when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly
## 5072                                                 estranged from each other.&quot;
## 5073                                                                            
## 5074       &quot;Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;you
## 5075            have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which
## 5076         occurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion,
## 5077                                               cannot be so easily removed.&quot;
## 5078                                                                            
## 5079                                                Marianne&#39;s countenance sunk.
## 5080                                                                            
## 5081         &quot;And what,&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood, &quot;is my dear prudent Elinor going to
## 5082     suggest?  What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward?  Do let
## 5083                                    me hear a word about the expense of it.&quot;
## 5084                                                                            
## 5085          &quot;My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings&#39;s
## 5086          heart, she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, or
## 5087                                 whose protection will give us consequence.&quot;
## 5088                                                                            
## 5089               &quot;That is very true,&quot; replied her mother, &quot;but of her society,
## 5090      separately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing
## 5091               at all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady
## 5092                                                                 Middleton.&quot;
## 5093                                                                            
## 5094        &quot;If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings,&quot; said
## 5095     Marianne, &quot;at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation.  I
## 5096              have no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every
## 5097                       unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort.&quot;
## 5098                                                                            
## 5099       Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards
## 5100            the manners of a person, to whom she had often had difficulty in
## 5101       persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolved
## 5102         within herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would go
## 5103       likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left
## 5104      to the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should
## 5105            be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her
## 5106              domestic hours.  To this determination she was the more easily
## 5107     reconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy&#39;s account, was
## 5108        not to be in town before February; and that their visit, without any
## 5109                     unreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.
## 5110                                                                            
## 5111        &quot;I will have you BOTH go,&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood; &quot;these objections are
## 5112           nonsensical.  You will have much pleasure in being in London, and
## 5113        especially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to
## 5114          anticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety of
## 5115                 sources; she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her
## 5116                              acquaintance with her sister-in-law&#39;s family.&quot;
## 5117                                                                            
## 5118      Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her
## 5119       mother&#39;s dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the
## 5120     shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on this
## 5121      attack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to begin
## 5122        her design by saying, as calmly as she could, &quot;I like Edward Ferrars
## 5123       very much, and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest of
## 5124      the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me, whether I am
## 5125                                                 ever known to them or not.&quot;
## 5126                                                                            
## 5127     Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing.  Marianne lifted up her eyes in
## 5128       astonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held
## 5129                                                                 her tongue.
## 5130                                                                            
## 5131        After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the
## 5132            invitation should be fully accepted.  Mrs. Jennings received the
## 5133       information with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness
## 5134      and care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her.  Sir John was
## 5135          delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of
## 5136        being alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in
## 5137       London, was something.  Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being
## 5138      delighted, which was putting herself rather out of her way; and as for
## 5139          the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy in
## 5140                                 their lives as this intelligence made them.
## 5141                                                                            
## 5142      Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with
## 5143     less reluctance than she had expected to feel.  With regard to herself,
## 5144       it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and
## 5145        when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her
## 5146        sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all
## 5147        her usual animation, and elevated to more than her usual gaiety, she
## 5148            could not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow
## 5149                                        herself to distrust the consequence.
## 5150                                                                            
## 5151       Marianne&#39;s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the
## 5152             perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone.  Her
## 5153      unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness;
## 5154         and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.
## 5155     Her mother&#39;s affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one of
## 5156      the three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of
## 5157                                                                    eternal.
## 5158                                                                            
## 5159               Their departure took place in the first week in January.  The
## 5160     Middletons were to follow in about a week.  The Miss Steeles kept their
## 5161          station at the park, and were to quit it only with the rest of the
## 5162                                                                     family.
## 5163                                                                            
## 5164                                                                            
## 5165                                                                            
## 5166                                                                  CHAPTER 26
## 5167                                                                            
## 5168                                                                            
## 5169       Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and
## 5170       beginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest,
## 5171     without wondering at her own situation, so short had their acquaintance
## 5172                with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age and
## 5173     disposition, and so many had been her objections against such a measure
## 5174       only a few days before! But these objections had all, with that happy
## 5175          ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared, been
## 5176      overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubt
## 5177      of Willoughby&#39;s constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightful
## 5178           expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of
## 5179     Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect, how cheerless
## 5180           her own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she would
## 5181           engage in the solicitude of Marianne&#39;s situation to have the same
## 5182         animating object in view, the same possibility of hope.  A short, a
## 5183        very short time however must now decide what Willoughby&#39;s intentions
## 5184      were; in all probability he was already in town.  Marianne&#39;s eagerness
## 5185     to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there; and Elinor was
## 5186          resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character
## 5187     which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,
## 5188            but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such
## 5189           zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he meant,
## 5190             before many meetings had taken place.  Should the result of her
## 5191      observations be unfavourable, she was determined at all events to open
## 5192      the eyes of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions would be
## 5193           of a different nature--she must then learn to avoid every selfish
## 5194     comparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction
## 5195                                               in the happiness of Marianne.
## 5196                                                                            
## 5197     They were three days on their journey, and Marianne&#39;s behaviour as they
## 5198              travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and
## 5199     companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be.  She sat in
## 5200      silence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely
## 5201     ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty
## 5202       within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively
## 5203       addressed to her sister.  To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinor
## 5204             took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had
## 5205     assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,
## 5206         talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever she
## 5207             could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with all
## 5208      possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and
## 5209     enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their
## 5210         own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferring
## 5211       salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets.  They reached town by
## 5212     three o&#39;clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey,
## 5213       from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury
## 5214                                                             of a good fire.
## 5215                                                                            
## 5216      The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young ladies
## 5217     were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment.  It
## 5218        had formerly been Charlotte&#39;s, and over the mantelpiece still hung a
## 5219      landscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof of her having
## 5220                 spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect.
## 5221                                                                            
## 5222             As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their
## 5223         arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her
## 5224       mother, and sat down for that purpose.  In a few moments Marianne did
## 5225         the same.  &quot;I am writing home, Marianne,&quot; said Elinor; &quot;had not you
## 5226                                 better defer your letter for a day or two?&quot;
## 5227                                                                            
## 5228      &quot;I am NOT going to write to my mother,&quot; replied Marianne, hastily, and
## 5229        as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry.  Elinor said no more; it
## 5230     immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby; and
## 5231               the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however
## 5232            mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be
## 5233       engaged.  This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her
## 5234               pleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.
## 5235     Marianne&#39;s was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be no
## 5236          more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with
## 5237      eager rapidity.  Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the
## 5238         direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the
## 5239     bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed
## 5240            for her to the two-penny post.  This decided the matter at once.
## 5241                                                                            
## 5242      Her spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them
## 5243          which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and this
## 5244     agitation increased as the evening drew on.  She could scarcely eat any
## 5245       dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed
## 5246                         anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.
## 5247                                                                            
## 5248     It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much
## 5249     engaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing.  The tea
## 5250     things were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed more
## 5251     than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly
## 5252        heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinor
## 5253          felt secure of its announcing Willoughby&#39;s approach, and Marianne,
## 5254          starting up, moved towards the door.  Every thing was silent; this
## 5255        could not be borne many seconds; she opened the door, advanced a few
## 5256       steps towards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returned
## 5257       into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard
## 5258         him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that
## 5259       instant she could not help exclaiming, &quot;Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby,
## 5260      indeed it is!&quot; and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms,
## 5261                                              when Colonel Brandon appeared.
## 5262                                                                            
## 5263     It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she immediately
## 5264       left the room.  Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time her
## 5265       regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her; and she felt
## 5266       particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive
## 5267         that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing
## 5268      him.  She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he even
## 5269       observed Marianne as she quitted the room, with such astonishment and
## 5270      concern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded
## 5271                                                            towards herself.
## 5272                                                                            
## 5273                                              &quot;Is your sister ill?&quot; said he.
## 5274                                                                            
## 5275           Elinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of
## 5276     head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to which
## 5277                        she could decently attribute her sister&#39;s behaviour.
## 5278                                                                            
## 5279      He heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect
## 5280        himself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of
## 5281     his pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries about
## 5282                        their journey, and the friends they had left behind.
## 5283                                                                            
## 5284         In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,
## 5285       they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts
## 5286          of both engaged elsewhere.  Elinor wished very much to ask whether
## 5287      Willoughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by
## 5288     any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying something,
## 5289        she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last.
## 5290      &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, with some embarrassment, &quot;almost ever since; I have
## 5291     been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been in
## 5292                                              my power to return to Barton.&quot;
## 5293                                                                            
## 5294      This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to
## 5295      her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, with
## 5296     the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and she
## 5297        was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the
## 5298                                             subject than she had ever felt.
## 5299                                                                            
## 5300        Mrs. Jennings soon came in.  &quot;Oh! Colonel,&quot; said she, with her usual
## 5301      noisy cheerfulness, &quot;I am monstrous glad to see you--sorry I could not
## 5302     come before--beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a
## 5303     little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have been
## 5304     at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do
## 5305     after one has been away for any time; and then I have had Cartwright to
## 5306         settle with-- Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!
## 5307     But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should be in town
## 5308                                                                     today?&quot;
## 5309                                                                            
## 5310        &quot;I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer&#39;s, where I have been
## 5311                                                                    dining.&quot;
## 5312                                                                            
## 5313        &quot;Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house?  How does
## 5314              Charlotte do?  I warrant you she is a fine size by this time.&quot;
## 5315                                                                            
## 5316        &quot;Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you,
## 5317                                 that you will certainly see her to-morrow.&quot;
## 5318                                                                            
## 5319      &quot;Ay, to be sure, I thought as much.  Well, Colonel, I have brought two
## 5320        young ladies with me, you see--that is, you see but one of them now,
## 5321     but there is another somewhere.  Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which
## 5322              you will not be sorry to hear.  I do not know what you and Mr.
## 5323     Willoughby will do between you about her.  Ay, it is a fine thing to be
## 5324           young and handsome.  Well! I was young once, but I never was very
## 5325     handsome--worse luck for me.  However, I got a very good husband, and I
## 5326      don&#39;t know what the greatest beauty can do more.  Ah! poor man! he has
## 5327        been dead these eight years and better.  But Colonel, where have you
## 5328          been to since we parted?  And how does your business go on?  Come,
## 5329                                 come, let&#39;s have no secrets among friends.&quot;
## 5330                                                                            
## 5331          He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but
## 5332       without satisfying her in any.  Elinor now began to make the tea, and
## 5333                                       Marianne was obliged to appear again.
## 5334                                                                            
## 5335       After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent
## 5336      than he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to
## 5337     stay long.  No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were
## 5338                                   unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.
## 5339                                                                            
## 5340      Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.
## 5341            The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the
## 5342     expectation of what was to happen that day.  They had not long finished
## 5343      their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer&#39;s barouche stopped at the door, and
## 5344       in a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to see
## 5345        them all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure
## 5346       from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again.  So surprised at
## 5347        their coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected all
## 5348     along; so angry at their accepting her mother&#39;s invitation after having
## 5349     declined her own, though at the same time she would never have forgiven
## 5350                                                  them if they had not come!
## 5351                                                                            
## 5352      &quot;Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,&quot; said she; &quot;What do you think
## 5353       he said when he heard of your coming with Mama?  I forget what it was
## 5354                                        now, but it was something so droll!&quot;
## 5355                                                                            
## 5356      After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat,
## 5357         or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their
## 5358      acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings&#39;s side, and in laughter without cause on
## 5359           Mrs. Palmer&#39;s, it was proposed by the latter that they should all
## 5360         accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning, to
## 5361        which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise
## 5362     some purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it at
## 5363                                           first was induced to go likewise.
## 5364                                                                            
## 5365         Wherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch.  In Bond
## 5366       Street especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in
## 5367     constant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind
## 5368      was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from all
## 5369         that interested and occupied the others.  Restless and dissatisfied
## 5370       every where, her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article
## 5371       of purchase, however it might equally concern them both: she received
## 5372      no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at home again, and
## 5373        could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs.
## 5374      Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing pretty, expensive, or new;
## 5375      who was wild to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her
## 5376                                             time in rapture and indecision.
## 5377                                                                            
## 5378     It was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner had
## 5379       they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and when
## 5380      Elinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful
## 5381              countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there.
## 5382                                                                            
## 5383        &quot;Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?&quot; said she to
## 5384     the footman who then entered with the parcels.  She was answered in the
## 5385       negative.  &quot;Are you quite sure of it?&quot; she replied.  &quot;Are you certain
## 5386                    that no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?&quot;
## 5387                                                                            
## 5388                                              The man replied that none had.
## 5389                                                                            
## 5390           &quot;How very odd!&quot; said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as she
## 5391                                                  turned away to the window.
## 5392                                                                            
## 5393     &quot;How odd, indeed!&quot; repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her sister
## 5394     with uneasiness.  &quot;If she had not known him to be in town she would not
## 5395     have written to him, as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna;
## 5396        and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come nor write!
## 5397           Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an engagement
## 5398     between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be carried on in
## 5399       so doubtful, so mysterious a manner!  I long to inquire; and how will
## 5400                                                  MY interference be borne.&quot;
## 5401                                                                            
## 5402     She determined, after some consideration, that if appearances continued
## 5403     many days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would represent in
## 5404            the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious
## 5405                                                    enquiry into the affair.
## 5406                                                                            
## 5407              Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings&#39;s intimate
## 5408       acquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined with
## 5409           them.  The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening
## 5410       engagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table
## 5411          for the others.  Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she
## 5412        would never learn the game; but though her time was therefore at her
## 5413       own disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure
## 5414               to her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of
## 5415      expectation and the pain of disappointment.  She sometimes endeavoured
## 5416      for a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she
## 5417        returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and
## 5418     forwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to the
## 5419                   window, in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.
## 5420                                                                            
## 5421                                                                            
## 5422                                                                            
## 5423                                                                  CHAPTER 27
## 5424                                                                            
## 5425                                                                            
## 5426     &quot;If this open weather holds much longer,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, when they
## 5427     met at breakfast the following morning, &quot;Sir John will not like leaving
## 5428            Barton next week; &#39;tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day&#39;s
## 5429       pleasure.  Poor souls!  I always pity them when they do; they seem to
## 5430                                                  take it so much to heart.&quot;
## 5431                                                                            
## 5432     &quot;That is true,&quot; cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to the
## 5433       window as she spoke, to examine the day.  &quot;I had not thought of that.
## 5434                      This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country.&quot;
## 5435                                                                            
## 5436      It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it.
## 5437         &quot;It is charming weather for THEM indeed,&quot; she continued, as she sat
## 5438       down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance.  &quot;How much they
## 5439         must enjoy it! But&quot; (with a little return of anxiety) &quot;it cannot be
## 5440          expected to last long.  At this time of the year, and after such a
## 5441     series of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it.  Frosts
## 5442     will soon set in, and in all probability with severity.  In another day
## 5443          or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer--nay,
## 5444                                             perhaps it may freeze tonight!&quot;
## 5445                                                                            
## 5446           &quot;At any rate,&quot; said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from
## 5447          seeing her sister&#39;s thoughts as clearly as she did, &quot;I dare say we
## 5448    shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week.&quot;
## 5449                                                                            
## 5450        &quot;Ay, my dear, I&#39;ll warrant you we do.  Mary always has her own way.&quot;
## 5451                                                                            
## 5452         &quot;And now,&quot; silently conjectured Elinor, &quot;she will write to Combe by
## 5453                                                           this day&#39;s post.&quot;
## 5454                                                                            
## 5455         But if she DID, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy
## 5456      which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact.  Whatever the
## 5457           truth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough
## 5458      contentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could
## 5459      not be very uncomfortable herself.  And Marianne was in spirits; happy
## 5460     in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation of
## 5461                                                                    a frost.
## 5462                                                                            
## 5463        The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs.
## 5464            Jennings&#39;s acquaintance to inform them of her being in town; and
## 5465      Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind,
## 5466       watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the
## 5467                                                                        air.
## 5468                                                                            
## 5469         &quot;Don&#39;t you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There
## 5470     seems to me a very decided difference.  I can hardly keep my hands warm
## 5471        even in my muff.  It was not so yesterday, I think.  The clouds seem
## 5472     parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a clear
## 5473                                                                 afternoon.&quot;
## 5474                                                                            
## 5475        Elinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered,
## 5476     and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning in
## 5477       the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching
## 5478                                                                      frost.
## 5479                                                                            
## 5480       The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.
## 5481          Jennings&#39;s style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her
## 5482     behaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind.  Every thing in her
## 5483          household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and
## 5484     excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton&#39;s regret, she
## 5485      had never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction could at
## 5486       all discompose the feelings of her young companions.  Pleased to find
## 5487           herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had
## 5488     expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real
## 5489      enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or
## 5490              abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.
## 5491                                                                            
## 5492        Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with
## 5493      them almost every day; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,
## 5494      who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from
## 5495          any other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much
## 5496           concern his continued regard for her sister.  She feared it was a
## 5497     strengthening regard.  It grieved her to see the earnestness with which
## 5498        he often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse than
## 5499                                                             when at Barton.
## 5500                                                                            
## 5501     About a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby was
## 5502         also arrived.  His card was on the table when they came in from the
## 5503                                                            morning&#39;s drive.
## 5504                                                                            
## 5505           &quot;Good God!&quot; cried Marianne, &quot;he has been here while we were out.&quot;
## 5506      Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his being in London, now ventured to
## 5507           say, &quot;Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow.&quot;  But Marianne
## 5508    seemed hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings&#39;s entrance, escaped with
## 5509                                                          the precious card.
## 5510                                                                            
## 5511     This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those of
## 5512       her sister all, and more than all, their former agitation.  From this
## 5513        moment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every
## 5514       hour of the day, made her unfit for any thing.  She insisted on being
## 5515                    left behind, the next morning, when the others went out.
## 5516                                                                            
## 5517     Elinor&#39;s thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street
## 5518         during their absence; but a moment&#39;s glance at her sister when they
## 5519       returned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second
## 5520       visit there.  A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table.
## 5521                                                                            
## 5522                         &quot;For me!&quot; cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.
## 5523                                                                            
## 5524                                               &quot;No, ma&#39;am, for my mistress.&quot;
## 5525                                                                            
## 5526                          But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.
## 5527                                                                            
## 5528                            &quot;It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!&quot;
## 5529                                                                            
## 5530        &quot;You are expecting a letter, then?&quot; said Elinor, unable to be longer
## 5531                                                                     silent.
## 5532                                                                            
## 5533                                                  &quot;Yes, a little--not much.&quot;
## 5534                                                                            
## 5535             After a short pause.  &quot;You have no confidence in me, Marianne.&quot;
## 5536                                                                            
## 5537         &quot;Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who have confidence in no
## 5538                                                                       one!&quot;
## 5539                                                                            
## 5540          &quot;Me!&quot; returned Elinor in some confusion; &quot;indeed, Marianne, I have
## 5541                                                           nothing to tell.&quot;
## 5542                                                                            
## 5543     &quot;Nor I,&quot; answered Marianne with energy, &quot;our situations then are alike.
## 5544            We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do not
## 5545                             communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing.&quot;
## 5546                                                                            
## 5547      Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she was
## 5548       not at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to
## 5549                                     press for greater openness in Marianne.
## 5550                                                                            
## 5551      Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it
## 5552     aloud.  It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit
## 5553       Street the night before, and requesting the company of her mother and
## 5554          cousins the following evening.  Business on Sir John&#39;s part, and a
## 5555        violent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.
## 5556          The invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drew
## 5557         near, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that
## 5558     they should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some difficulty
## 5559           in persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen nothing of
## 5560     Willoughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad,
## 5561         than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.
## 5562                                                                            
## 5563            Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not
## 5564      materially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled
## 5565        in town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty
## 5566           young people, and to amuse them with a ball.  This was an affair,
## 5567       however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve.  In the country, an
## 5568           unpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the
## 5569      reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it
## 5570       was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it
## 5571          known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine
## 5572                  couple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.
## 5573                                                                            
## 5574       Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had
## 5575     not seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to avoid
## 5576         the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and therefore
## 5577          never came near her, they received no mark of recognition on their
## 5578     entrance.  He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know who they
## 5579         were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the
## 5580      room.  Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered: it
## 5581     was enough--HE was not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed to
## 5582       receive or communicate pleasure.  After they had been assembled about
## 5583     an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his
## 5584      surprise on seeing them in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first
## 5585             informed of their arrival at his house, and he had himself said
## 5586                     something very droll on hearing that they were to come.
## 5587                                                                            
## 5588                           &quot;I thought you were both in Devonshire,&quot; said he.
## 5589                                                                            
## 5590                                                  &quot;Did you?&quot; replied Elinor.
## 5591                                                                            
## 5592                                                &quot;When do you go back again?&quot;
## 5593                                                                            
## 5594                            &quot;I do not know.&quot; And thus ended their discourse.
## 5595                                                                            
## 5596       Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she was
## 5597              that evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise.  She
## 5598                       complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street.
## 5599                                                                            
## 5600        &quot;Aye, aye,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, &quot;we know the reason of all that very
## 5601        well; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you
## 5602       would not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very
## 5603             pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.&quot;
## 5604                                                                            
## 5605                                                  &quot;Invited!&quot; cried Marianne.
## 5606                                                                            
## 5607            &quot;So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him
## 5608           somewhere in the street this morning.&quot; Marianne said no more, but
## 5609           looked exceedingly hurt.  Impatient in this situation to be doing
## 5610        something that might lead to her sister&#39;s relief, Elinor resolved to
## 5611      write the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fears
## 5612       for the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been
## 5613     so long delayed; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by
## 5614           perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again
## 5615      writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose it to be to any other
## 5616                                                                     person.
## 5617                                                                            
## 5618           About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on
## 5619         business, and Elinor began her letter directly, while Marianne, too
## 5620      restless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one
## 5621      window to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.
## 5622      Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating all
## 5623     that had passed, her suspicions of Willoughby&#39;s inconstancy, urging her
## 5624      by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account
## 5625                                  of her real situation with respect to him.
## 5626                                                                            
## 5627        Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and
## 5628         Colonel Brandon was announced.  Marianne, who had seen him from the
## 5629          window, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he
## 5630       entered it.  He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing
## 5631       satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat in
## 5632            particular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word.
## 5633       Elinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her
## 5634     sister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening.  It was not the
## 5635       first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more than
## 5636           once before, beginning with the observation of &quot;your sister looks
## 5637      unwell to-day,&quot; or &quot;your sister seems out of spirits,&quot; he had appeared
## 5638              on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring, something
## 5639      particular about her.  After a pause of several minutes, their silence
## 5640     was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he was
## 5641        to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother?  Elinor was not
## 5642       prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obliged
## 5643      to adopt the simple and common expedient, of asking what he meant?  He
## 5644              tried to smile as he replied, &quot;your sister&#39;s engagement to Mr.
## 5645                                        Willoughby is very generally known.&quot;
## 5646                                                                            
## 5647     &quot;It cannot be generally known,&quot; returned Elinor, &quot;for her own family do
## 5648                                                               not know it.&quot;
## 5649                                                                            
## 5650            He looked surprised and said, &quot;I beg your pardon, I am afraid my
## 5651            inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy
## 5652      intended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally
## 5653                                                                 talked of.&quot;
## 5654                                                                            
## 5655                 &quot;How can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?&quot;
## 5656                                                                            
## 5657     &quot;By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you are
## 5658         most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons.  But
## 5659           still I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps
## 5660          rather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to
## 5661         support its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,
## 5662       accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in
## 5663     your sister&#39;s writing.  I came to inquire, but I was convinced before I
## 5664             could ask the question.  Is every thing finally settled?  Is it
## 5665         impossible to-?  But I have no right, and I could have no chance of
## 5666      succeeding.  Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.  I believe I have been wrong in
## 5667        saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I
## 5668           have the strongest dependence.  Tell me that it is all absolutely
## 5669                resolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if
## 5670                              concealment be possible, is all that remains.&quot;
## 5671                                                                            
## 5672       These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for
## 5673        her sister, affected her very much.  She was not immediately able to
## 5674     say anything, and even when her spirits were recovered, she debated for
## 5675      a short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give.  The real
## 5676       state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known
## 5677      to herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as liable
## 5678               to say too much as too little.  Yet as she was convinced that
## 5679         Marianne&#39;s affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel
## 5680       Brandon&#39;s success, whatever the event of that affection might be, and
## 5681     at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure, she thought
## 5682        it most prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say more than
## 5683      she really knew or believed.  She acknowledged, therefore, that though
## 5684        she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they
## 5685      stood with each other, of their mutual affection she had no doubt, and
## 5686                     of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear.
## 5687                                                                            
## 5688      He listened to her with silent attention, and on her ceasing to speak,
## 5689        rose directly from his seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion,
## 5690      &quot;to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he
## 5691                  may endeavour to deserve her,&quot;--took leave, and went away.
## 5692                                                                            
## 5693           Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, to
## 5694     lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points; she was left, on the
## 5695                 contrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon&#39;s
## 5696         unhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by her
## 5697                            anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.
## 5698                                                                            
## 5699                                                                            
## 5700                                                                            
## 5701                                                                  CHAPTER 28
## 5702                                                                            
## 5703                                                                            
## 5704         Nothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor
## 5705         regret what she had done, in applying to her mother; for Willoughby
## 5706       neither came nor wrote.  They were engaged about the end of that time
## 5707      to attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept
## 5708     away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this party,
## 5709        Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and seeming
## 5710        equally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared, without one
## 5711                 look of hope or one expression of pleasure.  She sat by the
## 5712            drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton&#39;s
## 5713     arrival, without once stirring from her seat, or altering her attitude,
## 5714      lost in her own thoughts, and insensible of her sister&#39;s presence; and
## 5715      when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the
## 5716        door, she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected.
## 5717                                                                            
## 5718        They arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as
## 5719     the string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended the
## 5720       stairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to another
## 5721       in an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up, quite full
## 5722      of company, and insufferably hot.  When they had paid their tribute of
## 5723       politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were permitted
## 5724                to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and
## 5725     inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add.  After some
## 5726       time spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to
## 5727       Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she and
## 5728          Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great
## 5729                                                    distance from the table.
## 5730                                                                            
## 5731          They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived
## 5732                 Willoughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest
## 5733         conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman.  She soon
## 5734         caught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting to
## 5735     speak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her;
## 5736         and then continued his discourse with the same lady.  Elinor turned
## 5737         involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved by
## 5738     her.  At that moment she first perceived him, and her whole countenance
## 5739               glowing with sudden delight, she would have moved towards him
## 5740                           instantly, had not her sister caught hold of her.
## 5741                                                                            
## 5742      &quot;Good heavens!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;he is there--he is there--Oh! why does
## 5743                              he not look at me? why cannot I speak to him?&quot;
## 5744                                                                            
## 5745         &quot;Pray, pray be composed,&quot; cried Elinor, &quot;and do not betray what you
## 5746          feel to every body present.  Perhaps he has not observed you yet.&quot;
## 5747                                                                            
## 5748             This however was more than she could believe herself; and to be
## 5749     composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne, it
## 5750      was beyond her wish.  She sat in an agony of impatience which affected
## 5751                                                              every feature.
## 5752                                                                            
## 5753      At last he turned round again, and regarded them both; she started up,
## 5754       and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection, held out her hand to
## 5755           him.  He approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor than
## 5756     Marianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to observe
## 5757         her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, and
## 5758             asked how long they had been in town.  Elinor was robbed of all
## 5759     presence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a word.  But
## 5760          the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed.  Her face was
## 5761      crimsoned over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,
## 5762           &quot;Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?  Have you not
## 5763                    received my letters?  Will you not shake hands with me?&quot;
## 5764                                                                            
## 5765     He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and he
## 5766     held her hand only for a moment.  During all this time he was evidently
## 5767       struggling for composure.  Elinor watched his countenance and saw its
## 5768        expression becoming more tranquil.  After a moment&#39;s pause, he spoke
## 5769                                                              with calmness.
## 5770                                                                            
## 5771        &quot;I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,
## 5772             and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find
## 5773       yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home.  My card was not lost, I hope.&quot;
## 5774                                                                            
## 5775         &quot;But have you not received my notes?&quot; cried Marianne in the wildest
## 5776     anxiety.  &quot;Here is some mistake I am sure--some dreadful mistake.  What
## 5777      can be the meaning of it?  Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven&#39;s sake tell
## 5778                                                    me, what is the matter?&quot;
## 5779                                                                            
## 5780          He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment
## 5781     returned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he
## 5782     had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant exertion,
## 5783      he recovered himself again, and after saying, &quot;Yes, I had the pleasure
## 5784     of receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were so
## 5785       good as to send me,&quot; turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined
## 5786                                                                 his friend.
## 5787                                                                            
## 5788      Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into
## 5789       her chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her faint, tried
## 5790       to screen her from the observation of others, while reviving her with
## 5791                                                             lavender water.
## 5792                                                                            
## 5793      &quot;Go to him, Elinor,&quot; she cried, as soon as she could speak, &quot;and force
## 5794        him to come to me.  Tell him I must see him again--must speak to him
## 5795     instantly.-- I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment&#39;s peace till this
## 5796        is explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.-- Oh go to him
## 5797                                                               this moment.&quot;
## 5798                                                                            
## 5799     &quot;How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait.  This is
## 5800                  not the place for explanations.  Wait only till tomorrow.&quot;
## 5801                                                                            
## 5802            With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him
## 5803     herself; and to persuade her to check her agitation, to wait, at least,
## 5804     with the appearance of composure, till she might speak to him with more
## 5805             privacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued
## 5806       incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings,
## 5807     by exclamations of wretchedness.  In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby
## 5808       quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne
## 5809     that he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that
## 5810      evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm.  She instantly begged
## 5811       her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home, as she was
## 5812                                      too miserable to stay a minute longer.
## 5813                                                                            
## 5814         Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed
## 5815      that Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her
## 5816             wish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, they
## 5817          departed as soon the carriage could be found.  Scarcely a word was
## 5818           spoken during their return to Berkeley Street.  Marianne was in a
## 5819       silent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings
## 5820        was luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room,
## 5821             where hartshorn restored her a little to herself.  She was soon
## 5822        undressed and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, her
## 5823     sister then left her, and while she waited the return of Mrs. Jennings,
## 5824                              had leisure enough for thinking over the past.
## 5825                                                                            
## 5826           That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and
## 5827          Marianne she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it,
## 5828         seemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her own
## 5829                wishes, SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or
## 5830              misapprehension of any kind.  Nothing but a thorough change of
## 5831      sentiment could account for it.  Her indignation would have been still
## 5832        stronger than it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment which
## 5833        seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented
## 5834        her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with
## 5835        the affections of her sister from the first, without any design that
## 5836      would bear investigation.  Absence might have weakened his regard, and
## 5837       convenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such a
## 5838           regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt.
## 5839                                                                            
## 5840       As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already
## 5841     have given her, and on those still more severe which might await her in
## 5842         its probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepest
## 5843         concern.  Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she
## 5844       could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided in
## 5845         future, her mind might be always supported.  But every circumstance
## 5846      that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery
## 5847      of Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate and
## 5848                                            irreconcilable rupture with him.
## 5849                                                                            
## 5850                                                                            
## 5851                                                                            
## 5852                                                                  CHAPTER 29
## 5853                                                                            
## 5854                                                                            
## 5855           Before the house-maid had lit their fire the next day, or the sun
## 5856     gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne, only
## 5857     half dressed, was kneeling against one of the window-seats for the sake
## 5858      of all the little light she could command from it, and writing as fast
## 5859          as a continual flow of tears would permit her.  In this situation,
## 5860        Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, first perceived
## 5861         her; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety,
## 5862                         said, in a tone of the most considerate gentleness,
## 5863                                                                            
## 5864                                                     &quot;Marianne, may I ask-?&quot;
## 5865                                                                            
## 5866           &quot;No, Elinor,&quot; she replied, &quot;ask nothing; you will soon know all.&quot;
## 5867                                                                            
## 5868          The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted no
## 5869       longer than while she spoke, and was immediately followed by a return
## 5870     of the same excessive affliction.  It was some minutes before she could
## 5871         go on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which still
## 5872       obliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of
## 5873      her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the
## 5874                                                    last time to Willoughby.
## 5875                                                                            
## 5876     Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power; and
## 5877       she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more, had not
## 5878          Marianne entreated her, with all the eagerness of the most nervous
## 5879                   irritability, not to speak to her for the world.  In such
## 5880          circumstances, it was better for both that they should not be long
## 5881      together; and the restless state of Marianne&#39;s mind not only prevented
## 5882          her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed, but
## 5883          requiring at once solitude and continual change of place, made her
## 5884     wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding the sight of every
## 5885                                                                       body.
## 5886                                                                            
## 5887           At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; and
## 5888         Elinor&#39;s attention was then all employed, not in urging her, not in
## 5889         pitying her, nor in appearing to regard her, but in endeavouring to
## 5890                          engage Mrs. Jennings&#39;s notice entirely to herself.
## 5891                                                                            
## 5892                As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a
## 5893         considerable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it,
## 5894              round the common working table, when a letter was delivered to
## 5895      Marianne, which she eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of a
## 5896     death-like paleness, instantly ran out of the room.  Elinor, who saw as
## 5897        plainly by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must come
## 5898      from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her
## 5899       hardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremour as
## 5900    made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings&#39;s notice.  That good
## 5901            lady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from
## 5902           Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which she
## 5903     treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it to
## 5904           her liking.  Of Elinor&#39;s distress, she was too busily employed in
## 5905      measuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; and
## 5906      calmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said,
## 5907                                                                            
## 5908       &quot;Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my
## 5909        life!  MY girls were nothing to her, and yet they used to be foolish
## 5910      enough; but as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature.  I
## 5911           hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won&#39;t keep her waiting much
## 5912        longer, for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn.
## 5913                                         Pray, when are they to be married?&quot;
## 5914                                                                            
## 5915            Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment,
## 5916           obliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore,
## 5917      trying to smile, replied, &quot;And have you really, Ma&#39;am, talked yourself
## 5918        into a persuasion of my sister&#39;s being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?  I
## 5919         thought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems to
## 5920            imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceive
## 5921        yourself any longer.  I do assure you that nothing would surprise me
## 5922                      more than to hear of their being going to be married.&quot;
## 5923                                                                            
## 5924        &quot;For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so?  Don&#39;t we
## 5925      all know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in
## 5926         love with each other from the first moment they met?  Did not I see
## 5927      them together in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I
## 5928        know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding
## 5929       clothes?  Come, come, this won&#39;t do.  Because you are so sly about it
## 5930           yourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no such
## 5931     thing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever so
## 5932                      long.  I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte.&quot;
## 5933                                                                            
## 5934            &quot;Indeed, Ma&#39;am,&quot; said Elinor, very seriously, &quot;you are mistaken.
## 5935      Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, and
## 5936            you will find that you have though you will not believe me now.&quot;
## 5937                                                                            
## 5938        Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not spirits to say more,
## 5939        and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written, hurried
## 5940            away to their room, where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne
## 5941       stretched on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,
## 5942       and two or three others laying by her.  Elinor drew near, but without
## 5943        saying a word; and seating herself on the bed, took her hand, kissed
## 5944           her affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst of
## 5945        tears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne&#39;s. The
## 5946        latter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness of
## 5947     this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction, she
## 5948         put all the letters into Elinor&#39;s hands; and then covering her face
## 5949        with her handkerchief, almost screamed with agony.  Elinor, who knew
## 5950            that such grief, shocking as it was to witness it, must have its
## 5951     course, watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent
## 5952            itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby&#39;s letter, read as
## 5953                                                                    follows:
## 5954                                                                            
## 5955                                                      &quot;Bond Street, January.
## 5956                                                             &quot;MY DEAR MADAM,
## 5957                                                                            
## 5958                               &quot;I have just had the honour of receiving your
## 5959                                letter, for which I beg to return my sincere
## 5960                         acknowledgments.  I am much concerned to find there
## 5961                            was anything in my behaviour last night that did
## 5962                         not meet your approbation; and though I am quite at
## 5963                              a loss to discover in what point I could be so
## 5964                                unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your
## 5965                           forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been
## 5966                          perfectly unintentional.  I shall never reflect on
## 5967                       my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire
## 5968                             without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter
## 5969                              myself it will not be broken by any mistake or
## 5970                          misapprehension of my actions.  My esteem for your
## 5971                         whole family is very sincere; but if I have been so
## 5972                        unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than
## 5973                        I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach myself
## 5974                          for not having been more guarded in my professions
## 5975                         of that esteem.  That I should ever have meant more
## 5976                        you will allow to be impossible, when you understand
## 5977                        that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere,
## 5978                            and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before
## 5979                             this engagement is fulfilled.  It is with great
## 5980                           regret that I obey your commands in returning the
## 5981                           letters with which I have been honoured from you,
## 5982                      and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed
## 5983                                                                      on me.
## 5984                                                                            
## 5985                                                          &quot;I am, dear Madam,
## 5986                                                         &quot;Your most obedient
## 5987                                                            &quot;humble servant,
## 5988                                                          &quot;JOHN WILLOUGHBY.&quot;
## 5989                                                                            
## 5990                                                                            
## 5991            With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss
## 5992      Dashwood, may be imagined.  Though aware, before she began it, that it
## 5993               must bring a confession of his inconstancy, and confirm their
## 5994          separation for ever, she was not aware that such language could be
## 5995     suffered to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable
## 5996             of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and
## 5997      delicate feeling--so far from the common decorum of a gentleman, as to
## 5998      send a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of bringing
## 5999     with his desire of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no
## 6000        breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever--a letter of
## 6001       which every line was an insult, and which proclaimed its writer to be
## 6002                                                  deep in hardened villainy.
## 6003                                                                            
## 6004     She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment; then read
## 6005           it again and again; but every perusal only served to increase her
## 6006         abhorrence of the man, and so bitter were her feelings against him,
## 6007             that she dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound
## 6008     Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement, not as a loss to
## 6009           her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most
## 6010     irremediable of all evils, a connection, for life, with an unprincipled
## 6011         man, as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important.
## 6012                                                                            
## 6013            In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on the
## 6014         depravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on the
## 6015            very different mind of a very different person, who had no other
## 6016       connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with
## 6017        every thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her
## 6018     sister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread, and so
## 6019     entirely forgot how long she had been in the room, that when on hearing
## 6020          a carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see who
## 6021          could be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to
## 6022       perceive Mrs. Jennings&#39;s chariot, which she knew had not been ordered
## 6023              till one.  Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of
## 6024           contributing, at present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuse
## 6025        herself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being
## 6026     indisposed.  Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for
## 6027       its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeing
## 6028       her safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she found attempting to rise
## 6029         from the bed, and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from
## 6030       falling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest
## 6031         and food; for it was many days since she had any appetite, and many
## 6032     nights since she had really slept; and now, when her mind was no longer
## 6033         supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this was
## 6034           felt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous
## 6035        faintness.  A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,
## 6036         made her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express some
## 6037                                           sense of her kindness, by saying,
## 6038                                                                            
## 6039                                      &quot;Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make you!&quot;
## 6040                                                                            
## 6041        &quot;I only wish,&quot; replied her sister, &quot;there were any thing I COULD do,
## 6042                                          which might be of comfort to you.&quot;
## 6043                                                                            
## 6044       This, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne,
## 6045      who could only exclaim, in the anguish of her heart, &quot;Oh! Elinor, I am
## 6046             miserable, indeed,&quot; before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.
## 6047                                                                            
## 6048          Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in
## 6049                                                                    silence.
## 6050                                                                            
## 6051          &quot;Exert yourself, dear Marianne,&quot; she cried, &quot;if you would not kill
## 6052          yourself and all who love you.  Think of your mother; think of her
## 6053             misery while YOU suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself.&quot;
## 6054                                                                            
## 6055             &quot;I cannot, I cannot,&quot; cried Marianne; &quot;leave me, leave me, if I
## 6056      distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me!  but do not torture me so.
## 6057          Oh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of
## 6058           exertion!  Happy, happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what I
## 6059                                                                    suffer.&quot;
## 6060                                                                            
## 6061     &quot;Do you call ME happy, Marianne?  Ah! if you knew!--And can you believe
## 6062                                  me to be so, while I see you so wretched!&quot;
## 6063                                                                            
## 6064     &quot;Forgive me, forgive me,&quot; throwing her arms round her sister&#39;s neck; &quot;I
## 6065             know you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you
## 6066        are--you must be happy; Edward loves you--what, oh what, can do away
## 6067                                                    such happiness as that?&quot;
## 6068                                                                            
## 6069                          &quot;Many, many circumstances,&quot; said Elinor, solemnly.
## 6070                                                                            
## 6071      &quot;No, no, no,&quot; cried Marianne wildly, &quot;he loves you, and only you.  You
## 6072                                                         CAN have no grief.&quot;
## 6073                                                                            
## 6074                     &quot;I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state.&quot;
## 6075                                                                            
## 6076       &quot;And you will never see me otherwise.  Mine is a misery which nothing
## 6077                                                               can do away.&quot;
## 6078                                                                            
## 6079     &quot;You must not talk so, Marianne.  Have you no comforts? no friends?  Is
## 6080           your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation?  Much as you
## 6081       suffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of
## 6082        his character had been delayed to a later period--if your engagement
## 6083           had been carried on for months and months, as it might have been,
## 6084       before he chose to put an end to it.  Every additional day of unhappy
## 6085          confidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful.&quot;
## 6086                                                                            
## 6087               &quot;Engagement!&quot; cried Marianne, &quot;there has been no engagement.&quot;
## 6088                                                                            
## 6089                                                            &quot;No engagement!&quot;
## 6090                                                                            
## 6091      &quot;No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him.  He has broken no faith
## 6092                                                                   with me.&quot;
## 6093                                                                            
## 6094                                        &quot;But he told you that he loved you.&quot;
## 6095                                                                            
## 6096            &quot;Yes--no--never absolutely.  It was every day implied, but never
## 6097        professedly declared.  Sometimes I thought it had been--but it never
## 6098                                                                       was.&quot;
## 6099                                                                            
## 6100                                                   &quot;Yet you wrote to him?&quot;--
## 6101                                                                            
## 6102         &quot;Yes--could that be wrong after all that had passed?-- But I cannot
## 6103                                                                      talk.&quot;
## 6104                                                                            
## 6105       Elinor said no more, and turning again to the three letters which now
## 6106         raised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over the
## 6107      contents of all.  The first, which was what her sister had sent him on
## 6108                                  their arrival in town, was to this effect.
## 6109                                                                            
## 6110                                                   Berkeley Street, January.
## 6111                                                                            
## 6112                                  &quot;How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on
## 6113                         receiving this; and I think you will feel something
## 6114                        more than surprise, when you know that I am in town.
## 6115                           An opportunity of coming hither, though with Mrs.
## 6116                             Jennings, was a temptation we could not resist.
## 6117                            I wish you may receive this in time to come here
## 6118                         to-night, but I will not depend on it.  At any rate
## 6119                       I shall expect you to-morrow. For the present, adieu.
## 6120                                                                            
## 6121                                                                      &quot;M.D.&quot;
## 6122                                                                            
## 6123      Her second note, which had been written on the morning after the dance
## 6124                                   at the Middletons&#39;, was in these words:--
## 6125                                                                            
## 6126                               &quot;I cannot express my disappointment in having
## 6127                    missed you the day before yesterday, nor my astonishment
## 6128                           at not having received any answer to a note which
## 6129                         I sent you above a week ago.  I have been expecting
## 6130                          to hear from you, and still more to see you, every
## 6131                      hour of the day.  Pray call again as soon as possible,
## 6132                           and explain the reason of my having expected this
## 6133                         in vain.  You had better come earlier another time,
## 6134                          because we are generally out by one.  We were last
## 6135                         night at Lady Middleton&#39;s, where there was a dance.
## 6136                           I have been told that you were asked to be of the
## 6137                          party.  But could it be so?  You must be very much
## 6138                            altered indeed since we parted, if that could be
## 6139                        the case, and you not there.  But I will not suppose
## 6140                         this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your
## 6141                                  personal assurance of its being otherwise.
## 6142                                                                            
## 6143                                                                      &quot;M.D.&quot;
## 6144                                                                            
## 6145                          The contents of her last note to him were these:--
## 6146                                                                            
## 6147                                  &quot;What am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your
## 6148                        behaviour last night?  Again I demand an explanation
## 6149                        of it.  I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure
## 6150                           which our separation naturally produced, with the
## 6151                           familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared
## 6152                            to me to justify.  I was repulsed indeed! I have
## 6153                           passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse
## 6154                            a conduct which can scarcely be called less than
## 6155                           insulting; but though I have not yet been able to
## 6156                             form any reasonable apology for your behaviour,
## 6157                          I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of
## 6158                        it.  You have perhaps been misinformed, or purposely
## 6159                        deceived, in something concerning me, which may have
## 6160                            lowered me in your opinion.  Tell me what it is,
## 6161                         explain the grounds on which you acted, and I shall
## 6162                             be satisfied, in being able to satisfy you.  It
## 6163                           would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill
## 6164                         of you; but if I am to do it, if I am to learn that
## 6165                        you are not what we have hitherto believed you, that
## 6166                             your regard for us all was insincere, that your
## 6167                           behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let
## 6168                         it be told as soon as possible.  My feelings are at
## 6169                           present in a state of dreadful indecision; I wish
## 6170                         to acquit you, but certainty on either side will be
## 6171                          ease to what I now suffer.  If your sentiments are
## 6172                         no longer what they were, you will return my notes,
## 6173                        and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.
## 6174                                                                            
## 6175                                                                      &quot;M.D.&quot;
## 6176                                                                            
## 6177     That such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have been
## 6178       so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby&#39;s sake, would have been unwilling
## 6179           to believe.  But her condemnation of him did not blind her to the
## 6180       impropriety of their having been written at all; and she was silently
## 6181     grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs
## 6182       of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding, and most severely
## 6183     condemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving that she had finished
## 6184       the letters, observed to her that they contained nothing but what any
## 6185                               one would have written in the same situation.
## 6186                                                                            
## 6187        &quot;I felt myself,&quot; she added, &quot;to be as solemnly engaged to him, as if
## 6188                   the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other.&quot;
## 6189                                                                            
## 6190     &quot;I can believe it,&quot; said Elinor; &quot;but unfortunately he did not feel the
## 6191                                                                      same.&quot;
## 6192                                                                            
## 6193      &quot;He DID feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and weeks he felt it.  I know
## 6194            he did.  Whatever may have changed him now, (and nothing but the
## 6195      blackest art employed against me can have done it), I was once as dear
## 6196      to him as my own soul could wish.  This lock of hair, which now he can
## 6197                  so readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest
## 6198         supplication.  Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his
## 6199        voice at that moment!  Have you forgot the last evening of our being
## 6200       together at Barton?  The morning that we parted too!  When he told me
## 6201        that it might be many weeks before we met again--his distress--can I
## 6202                                                  ever forget his distress?&quot;
## 6203                                                                            
## 6204        For a moment or two she could say no more; but when this emotion had
## 6205                                   passed away, she added, in a firmer tone,
## 6206                                                                            
## 6207                  &quot;Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.&quot;
## 6208                                                                            
## 6209               &quot;Dearest Marianne, who but himself?  By whom can he have been
## 6210                                                                instigated?&quot;
## 6211                                                                            
## 6212            &quot;By all the world, rather than by his own heart.  I could rather
## 6213       believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me
## 6214      in his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty.  This
## 6215     woman of whom he writes--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but your
## 6216     own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to bely me.
## 6217         Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I would not
## 6218        rather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?&quot;
## 6219                                                                            
## 6220       Elinor would not contend, and only replied, &quot;Whoever may have been so
## 6221      detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph,
## 6222           my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own
## 6223               innocence and good intentions supports your spirits.  It is a
## 6224              reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence.&quot;
## 6225                                                                            
## 6226        &quot;No, no,&quot; cried Marianne, &quot;misery such as mine has no pride.  I care
## 6227       not who knows that I am wretched.  The triumph of seeing me so may be
## 6228       open to all the world.  Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be
## 6229            proud and independent as they like--may resist insult, or return
## 6230     mortification--but I cannot.  I must feel--I must be wretched--and they
## 6231                     are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can.&quot;
## 6232                                                                            
## 6233                                       &quot;But for my mother&#39;s sake and mine--&quot;
## 6234                                                                            
## 6235         &quot;I would do more than for my own.  But to appear happy when I am so
## 6236                                         miserable--Oh! who can require it?&quot;
## 6237                                                                            
## 6238                Again they were both silent.  Elinor was employed in walking
## 6239      thoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire,
## 6240            without knowing that she received warmth from one, or discerning
## 6241     objects through the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,
## 6242               with her head leaning against one of its posts, again took up
## 6243             Willoughby&#39;s letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence,
## 6244                                                                 exclaimed--
## 6245                                                                            
## 6246           &quot;It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours!
## 6247       Cruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you.  Elinor, nothing can.  Whatever
## 6248          he might have heard against me--ought he not to have suspended his
## 6249      belief? ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the power
## 6250      of clearing myself? &#39;The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)
## 6251              which you so obligingly bestowed on me&#39;--That is unpardonable.
## 6252           Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?  Oh,
## 6253                        barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?&quot;
## 6254                                                                            
## 6255                                         &quot;No, Marianne, in no possible way.&quot;
## 6256                                                                            
## 6257     &quot;And yet this woman--who knows what her art may have been?--how long it
## 6258        may have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her!--Who is
## 6259        she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and
## 6260           attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! no one, no one--he
## 6261                                               talked to me only of myself.&quot;
## 6262                                                                            
## 6263     Another pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended thus.
## 6264                                                                            
## 6265        &quot;Elinor, I must go home.  I must go and comfort mama.  Can not we be
## 6266                                                            gone to-morrow?&quot;
## 6267                                                                            
## 6268                                                      &quot;To-morrow, Marianne!&quot;
## 6269                                                                            
## 6270        &quot;Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for Willoughby&#39;s sake--and
## 6271                                      now who cares for me? Who regards me?&quot;
## 6272                                                                            
## 6273     &quot;It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much more
## 6274       than civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a
## 6275                                                     hasty removal as that.&quot;
## 6276                                                                            
## 6277     &quot;Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot stay here long, I
## 6278        cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people.
## 6279       The Middletons and Palmers--how am I to bear their pity?  The pity of
## 6280            such a woman as Lady Middleton!  Oh, what would HE say to that!&quot;
## 6281                                                                            
## 6282      Elinor advised her to lie down again, and for a moment she did so; but
## 6283      no attitude could give her ease; and in restless pain of mind and body
## 6284           she moved from one posture to another, till growing more and more
## 6285         hysterical, her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at
## 6286         all, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for
## 6287          assistance.  Some lavender drops, however, which she was at length
## 6288       persuaded to take, were of use; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings
## 6289                    returned, she continued on the bed quiet and motionless.
## 6290                                                                            
## 6291                                                                            
## 6292                                                                            
## 6293                                                                  CHAPTER 30
## 6294                                                                            
## 6295                                                                            
## 6296     Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return, and without
## 6297     waiting to have her request of admittance answered, opened the door and
## 6298                                      walked in with a look of real concern.
## 6299                                                                            
## 6300        &quot;How do you do my dear?&quot;--said she in a voice of great compassion to
## 6301            Marianne, who turned away her face without attempting to answer.
## 6302                                                                            
## 6303           &quot;How is she, Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing! she looks very bad.-- No
## 6304          wonder.  Ay, it is but too true.  He is to be married very soon--a
## 6305         good-for-nothing fellow!  I have no patience with him.  Mrs. Taylor
## 6306         told me of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particular
## 6307      friend of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed
## 6308      it; and I was almost ready to sink as it was.  Well, said I, all I can
## 6309                say is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my
## 6310       acquaintance abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife may
## 6311          plague his heart out.  And so I shall always say, my dear, you may
## 6312       depend on it.  I have no notion of men&#39;s going on in this way; and if
## 6313        ever I meet him again, I will give him such a dressing as he has not
## 6314      had this many a day.  But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne;
## 6315       he is not the only young man in the world worth having; and with your
## 6316       pretty face you will never want admirers.  Well, poor thing!  I won&#39;t
## 6317     disturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry out at once and
## 6318       have done with.  The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight
## 6319                                         you know, and that will amuse her.&quot;
## 6320                                                                            
## 6321            She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she
## 6322         supposed her young friend&#39;s affliction could be increased by noise.
## 6323                                                                            
## 6324          Marianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with
## 6325     them.  Elinor even advised her against it.  But &quot;no, she would go down;
## 6326       she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less.&quot;
## 6327         Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive,
## 6328      though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner,
## 6329         said no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,
## 6330      while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her into
## 6331                        the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.
## 6332                                                                            
## 6333     When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was calmer
## 6334      than her sister had expected.  Had she tried to speak, or had she been
## 6335      conscious of half Mrs. Jennings&#39;s well-meant but ill-judged attentions
## 6336             to her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but not a
## 6337              syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughts
## 6338      preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her.
## 6339                                                                            
## 6340             Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings&#39;s kindness, though its
## 6341     effusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous, made
## 6342     her those acknowledgments, and returned her those civilities, which her
## 6343         sister could not make or return for herself.  Their good friend saw
## 6344         that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was due to her
## 6345       which might make her at all less so.  She treated her therefore, with
## 6346     all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the
## 6347       last day of its holidays.  Marianne was to have the best place by the
## 6348       fire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and to
## 6349      be amused by the relation of all the news of the day.  Had not Elinor,
## 6350        in the sad countenance of her sister, seen a check to all mirth, she
## 6351         could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings&#39;s endeavours to cure a
## 6352        disappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a
## 6353          good fire.  As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was
## 6354       forced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could stay no longer.
## 6355         With a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her sister not to
## 6356                follow her, she directly got up and hurried out of the room.
## 6357                                                                            
## 6358          &quot;Poor soul!&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone, &quot;how it
## 6359       grieves me to see her!  And I declare if she is not gone away without
## 6360       finishing her wine!  And the dried cherries too!  Lord! nothing seems
## 6361     to do her any good.  I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I
## 6362       would send all over the town for it.  Well, it is the oddest thing to
## 6363     me, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill!  But when there is
## 6364      plenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord bless
## 6365                                you! they care no more about such things!--&quot;
## 6366                                                                            
## 6367            &quot;The lady then--Miss Grey I think you called her--is very rich?&quot;
## 6368                                                                            
## 6369            &quot;Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.  Did you ever see her? a smart,
## 6370          stylish girl they say, but not handsome.  I remember her aunt very
## 6371       well, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man.  But the family
## 6372      are all rich together.  Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it
## 6373        won&#39;t come before it&#39;s wanted; for they say he is all to pieces.  No
## 6374        wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters!  Well, it don&#39;t
## 6375      signify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makes
## 6376     love to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to fly
## 6377          off from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl is
## 6378      ready to have him.  Why don&#39;t he, in such a case, sell his horses, let
## 6379     his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once? I
## 6380       warrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters
## 6381            came round.  But that won&#39;t do now-a-days; nothing in the way of
## 6382                pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age.&quot;
## 6383                                                                            
## 6384           &quot;Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is?  Is she said to be
## 6385                                                                   amiable?&quot;
## 6386                                                                            
## 6387              &quot;I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard her
## 6388       mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day
## 6389     Miss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would
## 6390      not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison could
## 6391                                                             never agree.&quot;--
## 6392                                                                            
## 6393                                                 &quot;And who are the Ellisons?&quot;
## 6394                                                                            
## 6395          &quot;Her guardians, my dear.  But now she is of age and may choose for
## 6396      herself; and a pretty choice she has made!--What now,&quot; after pausing a
## 6397       moment--&quot;your poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan
## 6398       by herself.  Is there nothing one can get to comfort her?  Poor dear,
## 6399         it seems quite cruel to let her be alone.  Well, by-and-by we shall
## 6400        have a few friends, and that will amuse her a little.  What shall we
## 6401      play at?  She hates whist I know; but is there no round game she cares
## 6402                                                                       for?&quot;
## 6403                                                                            
## 6404     &quot;Dear ma&#39;am, this kindness is quite unnecessary.  Marianne, I dare say,
## 6405      will not leave her room again this evening.  I shall persuade her if I
## 6406                      can to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest.&quot;
## 6407                                                                            
## 6408            &quot;Aye, I believe that will be best for her.  Let her name her own
## 6409     supper, and go to bed.  Lord! no wonder she has been looking so bad and
## 6410      so cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been
## 6411         hanging over her head as long as that.  And so the letter that came
## 6412      today finished it!  Poor soul!  I am sure if I had had a notion of it,
## 6413         I would not have joked her about it for all my money.  But then you
## 6414            know, how should I guess such a thing?  I made sure of its being
## 6415      nothing but a common love letter, and you know young people like to be
## 6416      laughed at about them.  Lord!  how concerned Sir John and my daughters
## 6417        will be when they hear it!  If I had my senses about me I might have
## 6418        called in Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it.  But I
## 6419                                                   shall see them tomorrow.&quot;
## 6420                                                                            
## 6421      &quot;It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and
## 6422        Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest
## 6423       allusion to what has passed, before my sister.  Their own good-nature
## 6424      must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing
## 6425         about it when she is present; and the less that may ever be said to
## 6426       myself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my
## 6427                                            dear madam will easily believe.&quot;
## 6428                                                                            
## 6429      &quot;Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed.  It must be terrible for you to hear
## 6430       it talked of; and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention a
## 6431     word about it to her for the world.  You saw I did not all dinner time.
## 6432             No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very
## 6433          thoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint, as I
## 6434      certainly will.  For my part, I think the less that is said about such
## 6435        things, the better, the sooner &#39;tis blown over and forgot.  And what
## 6436                                             does talking ever do you know?&quot;
## 6437                                                                            
## 6438     &quot;In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many cases
## 6439     of a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances which, for
## 6440          the sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become the
## 6441      public conversation.  I must do THIS justice to Mr. Willoughby--he has
## 6442                              broken no positive engagement with my sister.&quot;
## 6443                                                                            
## 6444        &quot;Law, my dear!  Don&#39;t pretend to defend him.  No positive engagement
## 6445         indeed! after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the
## 6446                                 very rooms they were to live in hereafter!&quot;
## 6447                                                                            
## 6448     Elinor, for her sister&#39;s sake, could not press the subject farther, and
## 6449        she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby&#39;s; since, though
## 6450      Marianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the enforcement
## 6451     of the real truth.  After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,
## 6452                           with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.
## 6453                                                                            
## 6454        &quot;Well, my dear, &#39;tis a true saying about an ill-wind, for it will be
## 6455         all the better for Colonel Brandon.  He will have her at last; aye,
## 6456     that he will.  Mind me, now, if they an&#39;t married by Mid-summer.  Lord!
## 6457         how he&#39;ll chuckle over this news!  I hope he will come tonight.  It
## 6458     will be all to one a better match for your sister.  Two thousand a year
## 6459      without debt or drawback--except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I
## 6460     had forgot her; but she may be &#39;prenticed out at a small cost, and then
## 6461            what does it signify?  Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you;
## 6462        exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and
## 6463        conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered
## 6464       with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in
## 6465      one corner!  Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were
## 6466       there!  Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a
## 6467      very pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for;
## 6468      and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile
## 6469      from the turnpike-road, so &#39;tis never dull, for if you only go and sit
## 6470     up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriages
## 6471          that pass along.  Oh! &#39;tis a nice place!  A butcher hard by in the
## 6472      village, and the parsonage-house within a stone&#39;s throw.  To my fancy,
## 6473        a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to
## 6474       send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than
## 6475         your mother.  Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can.
## 6476       One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down.  If we CAN but
## 6477                                            put Willoughby out of her head!&quot;
## 6478                                                                            
## 6479         &quot;Ay, if we can do THAT, Ma&#39;am,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;we shall do very well
## 6480         with or without Colonel Brandon.&quot; And then rising, she went away to
## 6481            join Marianne, whom she found, as she expected, in her own room,
## 6482         leaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which,
## 6483                            till Elinor&#39;s entrance, had been her only light.
## 6484                                                                            
## 6485      &quot;You had better leave me,&quot; was all the notice that her sister received
## 6486                                                                   from her.
## 6487                                                                            
## 6488         &quot;I will leave you,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;if you will go to bed.&quot; But this,
## 6489        from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at first
## 6490             refused to do.  Her sister&#39;s earnest, though gentle persuasion,
## 6491        however, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay her
## 6492     aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some quiet
## 6493                                                   rest before she left her.
## 6494                                                                            
## 6495      In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined by
## 6496           Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand.
## 6497                                                                            
## 6498         &quot;My dear,&quot; said she, entering, &quot;I have just recollected that I have
## 6499           some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was
## 6500           tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister.  My poor
## 6501         husband! how fond he was of it!  Whenever he had a touch of his old
## 6502       colicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the
## 6503                                         world.  Do take it to your sister.&quot;
## 6504                                                                            
## 6505              &quot;Dear Ma&#39;am,&quot; replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the
## 6506     complaints for which it was recommended, &quot;how good you are!  But I have
## 6507       just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think
## 6508      nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me
## 6509                                       leave, I will drink the wine myself.&quot;
## 6510                                                                            
## 6511         Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes
## 6512              earlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she
## 6513          swallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a
## 6514     colicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its healing
## 6515     powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself
## 6516                                                           as on her sister.
## 6517                                                                            
## 6518      Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his manner
## 6519     of looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied that
## 6520     he neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he
## 6521        was already aware of what occasioned her absence.  Mrs. Jennings was
## 6522     not struck by the same thought; for soon after his entrance, she walked
## 6523     across the room to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered--
## 6524       &quot;The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.  He knows nothing of it;
## 6525                                                      do tell him, my dear.&quot;
## 6526                                                                            
## 6527          He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers, and, with a look
## 6528     which perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after her
## 6529                                                                     sister.
## 6530                                                                            
## 6531        &quot;Marianne is not well,&quot; said she.  &quot;She has been indisposed all day,
## 6532                                    and we have persuaded her to go to bed.&quot;
## 6533                                                                            
## 6534        &quot;Perhaps, then,&quot; he hesitatingly replied, &quot;what I heard this morning
## 6535      may be--there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at
## 6536                                                                     first.&quot;
## 6537                                                                            
## 6538                                                        &quot;What did you hear?&quot;
## 6539                                                                            
## 6540        &quot;That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in short, that a man,
## 6541        whom I KNEW to be engaged--but how shall I tell you?  If you know it
## 6542                              already, as surely you must, I may be spared.&quot;
## 6543                                                                            
## 6544        &quot;You mean,&quot; answered Elinor, with forced calmness, &quot;Mr. Willoughby&#39;s
## 6545       marriage with Miss Grey.  Yes, we DO know it all.  This seems to have
## 6546     been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded
## 6547         it to us.  Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable!  Where did you hear it?&quot;
## 6548                                                                            
## 6549      &quot;In a stationer&#39;s shop in Pall Mall, where I had business.  Two ladies
## 6550       were waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other
## 6551           an account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting
## 6552       concealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all.  The name
## 6553        of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my
## 6554      attention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing
## 6555      was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was
## 6556      no longer to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,
## 6557        with many particulars of preparations and other matters.  One thing,
## 6558         especially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still
## 6559           more:--as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe
## 6560        Magna, his seat in Somersetshire.  My astonishment!--but it would be
## 6561       impossible to describe what I felt.  The communicative lady I learnt,
## 6562        on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs.
## 6563       Ellison, and that, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss
## 6564                                                           Grey&#39;s guardian.&quot;
## 6565                                                                            
## 6566      &quot;It is.  But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand
## 6567             pounds?  In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation.&quot;
## 6568                                                                            
## 6569     &quot;It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least I think&quot;--he stopped
## 6570       a moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself, &quot;And
## 6571                                                 your sister--how did she--&quot;
## 6572                                                                            
## 6573       &quot;Her sufferings have been very severe.  I have only to hope that they
## 6574              may be proportionately short.  It has been, it is a most cruel
## 6575       affliction.  Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard;
## 6576          and even now, perhaps--but I am almost convinced that he never was
## 6577           really attached to her.  He has been very deceitful! and, in some
## 6578                         points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.&quot;
## 6579                                                                            
## 6580        &quot;Ah!&quot; said Colonel Brandon, &quot;there is, indeed!  But your sister does
## 6581           not--I think you said so--she does not consider quite as you do?&quot;
## 6582                                                                            
## 6583      &quot;You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would still
## 6584                                                  justify him if she could.&quot;
## 6585                                                                            
## 6586               He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of the
## 6587        tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject was
## 6588     necessarily dropped.  Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasure
## 6589         while they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of Miss
## 6590        Dashwood&#39;s communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel
## 6591        Brandon&#39;s side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of
## 6592       hope and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole evening
## 6593                                     more serious and thoughtful than usual.
## 6594                                                                            
## 6595                                                                            
## 6596                                                                            
## 6597                                                                  CHAPTER 31
## 6598                                                                            
## 6599                                                                            
## 6600        From a night of more sleep than she had expected, Marianne awoke the
## 6601           next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had
## 6602                                                            closed her eyes.
## 6603                                                                            
## 6604     Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt; and
## 6605     before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject again and
## 6606      again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on
## 6607          Elinor&#39;s side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on
## 6608     Marianne&#39;s, as before.  Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as
## 6609           unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at others, lost every
## 6610      consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him.  At one moment she
## 6611          was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world, at
## 6612          another she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third
## 6613       could resist it with energy.  In one thing, however, she was uniform,
## 6614          when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was possible, the
## 6615      presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence when obliged to
## 6616               endure it.  Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs.
## 6617                   Jennings&#39;s entering into her sorrows with any compassion.
## 6618                                                                            
## 6619      &quot;No, no, no, it cannot be,&quot; she cried; &quot;she cannot feel.  Her kindness
## 6620     is not sympathy; her good-nature is not tenderness.  All that she wants
## 6621                  is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.&quot;
## 6622                                                                            
## 6623      Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her
## 6624             sister was often led in her opinion of others, by the irritable
## 6625      refinement of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her
## 6626     on the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished
## 6627        manner.  Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there be
## 6628         that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities and an
## 6629     excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid.  She expected
## 6630        from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she
## 6631         judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on
## 6632     herself.  Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters were together
## 6633             in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart of Mrs.
## 6634            Jennings still lower in her estimation; because, through her own
## 6635     weakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself, though
## 6636      Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill.
## 6637                                                                            
## 6638      With a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling,
## 6639    from the persuasion of bringing comfort, she entered their room, saying,
## 6640                                                                            
## 6641      &quot;Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good.&quot;
## 6642                                                                            
## 6643     Marianne heard enough.  In one moment her imagination placed before her
## 6644                a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness and contrition,
## 6645           explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory, convincing; and
## 6646     instantly followed by Willoughby himself, rushing eagerly into the room
## 6647       to inforce, at her feet, by the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances
## 6648      of his letter.  The work of one moment was destroyed by the next.  The
## 6649      hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome, was before her;
## 6650          and, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an
## 6651       ecstasy of more than hope, she felt as if, till that instant, she had
## 6652                                                             never suffered.
## 6653                                                                            
## 6654           The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within her reach in her
## 6655      moments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed; and now she could
## 6656            reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with
## 6657           passionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely lost on its
## 6658            object, that after many expressions of pity, she withdrew, still
## 6659       referring her to the letter of comfort.  But the letter, when she was
## 6660          calm enough to read it, brought little comfort.  Willoughby filled
## 6661           every page.  Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and
## 6662         relying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by
## 6663     Elinor&#39;s application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards
## 6664       them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such affection
## 6665     for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future happiness in each
## 6666                    other, that she wept with agony through the whole of it.
## 6667                                                                            
## 6668         All her impatience to be at home again now returned; her mother was
## 6669     dearer to her than ever; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken
## 6670             confidence in Willoughby, and she was wildly urgent to be gone.
## 6671     Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne
## 6672       to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own except of
## 6673       patience till their mother&#39;s wishes could be known; and at length she
## 6674                   obtained her sister&#39;s consent to wait for that knowledge.
## 6675                                                                            
## 6676       Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she could not be easy
## 6677     till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself;
## 6678     and positively refusing Elinor&#39;s offered attendance, went out alone for
## 6679     the rest of the morning.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the
## 6680            pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne&#39;s
## 6681     letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it, then
## 6682     sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed, and entreat
## 6683            her directions for the future; while Marianne, who came into the
## 6684     drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings&#39;s going away, remained fixed at the table
## 6685      where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen, grieving over
## 6686         her for the hardship of such a task, and grieving still more fondly
## 6687                                              over its effect on her mother.
## 6688                                                                            
## 6689          In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, when
## 6690            Marianne, whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise, was
## 6691                                              startled by a rap at the door.
## 6692                                                                            
## 6693      &quot;Who can this be?&quot; cried Elinor.  &quot;So early too! I thought we HAD been
## 6694                                                                      safe.&quot;
## 6695                                                                            
## 6696                                              Marianne moved to the window--
## 6697                                                                            
## 6698       &quot;It is Colonel Brandon!&quot; said she, with vexation.  &quot;We are never safe
## 6699                                                                  from HIM.&quot;
## 6700                                                                            
## 6701                       &quot;He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.&quot;
## 6702                                                                            
## 6703     &quot;I will not trust to THAT,&quot; retreating to her own room.  &quot;A man who has
## 6704       nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on
## 6705                                                            that of others.&quot;
## 6706                                                                            
## 6707             The event proved her conjecture right, though it was founded on
## 6708       injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon DID come in; and Elinor, who
## 6709     was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who
## 6710        saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look, and in his
## 6711        anxious though brief inquiry after her, could not forgive her sister
## 6712                                               for esteeming him so lightly.
## 6713                                                                            
## 6714              &quot;I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street,&quot; said he, after the first
## 6715           salutation, &quot;and she encouraged me to come on; and I was the more
## 6716      easily encouraged, because I thought it probable that I might find you
## 6717     alone, which I was very desirous of doing.  My object--my wish--my sole
## 6718           wish in desiring it--I hope, I believe it is--is to be a means of
## 6719       giving comfort;--no, I must not say comfort--not present comfort--but
## 6720        conviction, lasting conviction to your sister&#39;s mind.  My regard for
## 6721       her, for yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it, by
## 6722                relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere
## 6723         regard--nothing but an earnest desire of being useful--I think I am
## 6724         justified--though where so many hours have been spent in convincing
## 6725           myself that I am right, is there not some reason to fear I may be
## 6726                                                         wrong?&quot; He stopped.
## 6727                                                                            
## 6728     &quot;I understand you,&quot; said Elinor.  &quot;You have something to tell me of Mr.
## 6729     Willoughby, that will open his character farther.  Your telling it will
## 6730           be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne.  MY
## 6731         gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to
## 6732         that end, and HERS must be gained by it in time.  Pray, pray let me
## 6733                                                                   hear it.&quot;
## 6734                                                                            
## 6735      &quot;You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,--but
## 6736     this will give you no idea--I must go farther back.  You will find me a
## 6737      very awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin.  A
## 6738      short account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it SHALL be
## 6739       a short one.  On such a subject,&quot; sighing heavily, &quot;can I have little
## 6740                                                  temptation to be diffuse.&quot;
## 6741                                                                            
## 6742       He stopt a moment for recollection, and then, with another sigh, went
## 6743                                                                         on.
## 6744                                                                            
## 6745      &quot;You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--(it is not to be
## 6746          supposed that it could make any impression on you)--a conversation
## 6747              between us one evening at Barton Park--it was the evening of a
## 6748     dance--in which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in
## 6749                                        some measure, your sister Marianne.&quot;
## 6750                                                                            
## 6751     &quot;Indeed,&quot; answered Elinor, &quot;I have NOT forgotten it.&quot; He looked pleased
## 6752                                             by this remembrance, and added,
## 6753                                                                            
## 6754          &quot;If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender
## 6755      recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well
## 6756         in mind as person.  The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of
## 6757           fancy and spirits.  This lady was one of my nearest relations, an
## 6758      orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.  Our
## 6759              ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were
## 6760         playfellows and friends.  I cannot remember the time when I did not
## 6761           love Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as
## 6762         perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you
## 6763         might think me incapable of having ever felt.  Hers, for me, was, I
## 6764     believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and
## 6765             it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.  At
## 6766            seventeen she was lost to me for ever.  She was married--married
## 6767      against her inclination to my brother.  Her fortune was large, and our
## 6768        family estate much encumbered.  And this, I fear, is all that can be
## 6769        said for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.
## 6770      My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.  I had hoped
## 6771      that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty, and for
## 6772          some time it did; but at last the misery of her situation, for she
## 6773       experienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though
## 6774         she had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I relate!  I have
## 6775      never told you how this was brought on.  We were within a few hours of
## 6776          eloping together for Scotland.  The treachery, or the folly, of my
## 6777       cousin&#39;s maid betrayed us.  I was banished to the house of a relation
## 6778      far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,
## 6779     till my father&#39;s point was gained.  I had depended on her fortitude too
## 6780     far, and the blow was a severe one--but had her marriage been happy, so
## 6781      young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at
## 6782         least I should not have now to lament it.  This however was not the
## 6783        case.  My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not what
## 6784        they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her unkindly.
## 6785                The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so
## 6786         inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon&#39;s, was but too natural.  She resigned
## 6787       herself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it
## 6788               been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the
## 6789          remembrance of me occasioned.  But can we wonder that, with such a
## 6790           husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or
## 6791             restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their
## 6792         marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should
## 6793       fall?  Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I meant to promote the
## 6794      happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purpose
## 6795      had procured my exchange.  The shock which her marriage had given me,&quot;
## 6796               he continued, in a voice of great agitation, &quot;was of trifling
## 6797            weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years
## 6798      afterwards, of her divorce.  It was THAT which threw this gloom,--even
## 6799                                  now the recollection of what I suffered--&quot;
## 6800                                                                            
## 6801     He could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about
## 6802          the room.  Elinor, affected by his relation, and still more by his
## 6803     distress, could not speak.  He saw her concern, and coming to her, took
## 6804           her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect.  A few
## 6805      minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.
## 6806                                                                            
## 6807      &quot;It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned
## 6808        to England.  My first care, when I DID arrive, was of course to seek
## 6809     for her; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy.  I could
## 6810       not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to
## 6811         fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of
## 6812              sin.  Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor
## 6813            sufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my
## 6814       brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months
## 6815     before to another person.  He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it,
## 6816          that her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to
## 6817     dispose of it for some immediate relief.  At last, however, and after I
## 6818        had been six months in England, I DID find her.  Regard for a former
## 6819      servant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to
## 6820          visit him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; and
## 6821   there, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my unfortunate
## 6822        sister.  So altered--so faded--worn down by acute suffering of every
## 6823        kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before
## 6824      me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl, on whom
## 6825        I had once doted.  What I endured in so beholding her--but I have no
## 6826           right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it--I have
## 6827       pained you too much already.  That she was, to all appearance, in the
## 6828        last stage of a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was my
## 6829        greatest comfort.  Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving time
## 6830          for a better preparation for death; and that was given.  I saw her
## 6831      placed in comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited
## 6832      her every day during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her
## 6833                                                              last moments.&quot;
## 6834                                                                            
## 6835       Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings in
## 6836    an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate friend.
## 6837                                                                            
## 6838     &quot;Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,&quot; said he, &quot;by the resemblance
## 6839           I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation.  Their
## 6840        fates, their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet
## 6841          disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier
## 6842       marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see the other
## 6843       be.  But to what does all this lead?  I seem to have been distressing
## 6844      you for nothing.  Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched
## 6845         for fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!  I WILL be
## 6846        more collected--more concise.  She left to my care her only child, a
## 6847     little girl, the offspring of her first guilty connection, who was then
## 6848         about three years old.  She loved the child, and had always kept it
## 6849      with her.  It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would I
## 6850             have discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her
## 6851        education myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I
## 6852         had no family, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at
## 6853        school.  I saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my
## 6854     brother, (which happened about five years ago, and which left to me the
## 6855          possession of the family property,) she visited me at Delaford.  I
## 6856           called her a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have in
## 6857     general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her.  It is now
## 6858          three years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,) that I
## 6859              removed her from school, to place her under the care of a very
## 6860      respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four
## 6861     or five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I
## 6862      had every reason to be pleased with her situation.  But last February,
## 6863         almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.  I had allowed
## 6864      her, (imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire,
## 6865          to go to Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending her
## 6866     father there for his health.  I knew him to be a very good sort of man,
## 6867     and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved, for, with
## 6868      a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would
## 6869             give no clue, though she certainly knew all.  He, her father, a
## 6870         well-meaning, but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe,
## 6871       give no information; for he had been generally confined to the house,
## 6872     while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance
## 6873            they chose; and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was
## 6874      convinced himself, of his daughter&#39;s being entirely unconcerned in the
## 6875       business.  In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone; all
## 6876            the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.  What I
## 6877          thought, what I feared, may be imagined; and what I suffered too.&quot;
## 6878                                                                            
## 6879            &quot;Good heavens!&quot; cried Elinor, &quot;could it be--could Willoughby!&quot;--
## 6880                                                                            
## 6881           &quot;The first news that reached me of her,&quot; he continued, &quot;came in a
## 6882             letter from herself, last October.  It was forwarded to me from
## 6883       Delaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party
## 6884      to Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,
## 6885       which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body,
## 6886        and which I believe gave offence to some.  Little did Mr. Willoughby
## 6887            imagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in
## 6888     breaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom
## 6889     he had made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it, what would it have
## 6890        availed?  Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of
## 6891       your sister?  No, he had already done that, which no man who CAN feel
## 6892       for another would do.  He had left the girl whose youth and innocence
## 6893              he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with no
## 6894      creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address!  He had
## 6895          left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor
## 6896                                                              relieved her.&quot;
## 6897                                                                            
## 6898                             &quot;This is beyond every thing!&quot; exclaimed Elinor.
## 6899                                                                            
## 6900     &quot;His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse than
## 6901      both.  Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess what
## 6902       I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever, and on
## 6903        being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt
## 6904      for all your sakes.  When I came to you last week and found you alone,
## 6905      I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to do when
## 6906       it WAS known.  My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; but
## 6907        now you will comprehend it.  To suffer you all to be so deceived; to
## 6908         see your sister--but what could I do?  I had no hope of interfering
## 6909     with success; and sometimes I thought your sister&#39;s influence might yet
## 6910     reclaim him.  But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what
## 6911     were his designs on her.  Whatever they may have been, however, she may
## 6912       now, and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own
## 6913        condition, when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she
## 6914        considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and
## 6915      pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong, still as
## 6916        strong as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which
## 6917     must attend her through life.  Surely this comparison must have its use
## 6918            with her.  She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.  They
## 6919              proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.  On the
## 6920          contrary, every friend must be made still more her friend by them.
## 6921        Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for her fortitude under it,
## 6922     must strengthen every attachment.  Use your own discretion, however, in
## 6923         communicating to her what I have told you.  You must know best what
## 6924     will be its effect; but had I not seriously, and from my heart believed
## 6925          it might be of service, might lessen her regrets, I would not have
## 6926               suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family
## 6927         afflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been intended to
## 6928                                     raise myself at the expense of others.&quot;
## 6929                                                                            
## 6930             Elinor&#39;s thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness;
## 6931      attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to
## 6932                        Marianne, from the communication of what had passed.
## 6933                                                                            
## 6934        &quot;I have been more pained,&quot; said she, &quot;by her endeavors to acquit him
## 6935          than by all the rest; for it irritates her mind more than the most
## 6936        perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do.  Now, though at first
## 6937          she will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier.  Have
## 6938       you,&quot; she continued, after a short silence, &quot;ever seen Mr. Willoughby
## 6939                                              since you left him at Barton?&quot;
## 6940                                                                            
## 6941     &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied gravely, &quot;once I have.  One meeting was unavoidable.&quot;
## 6942                                                                            
## 6943            Elinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously, saying,
## 6944                                                                            
## 6945                                               &quot;What? have you met him to--&quot;
## 6946                                                                            
## 6947     &quot;I could meet him no other way.  Eliza had confessed to me, though most
## 6948     reluctantly, the name of her lover; and when he returned to town, which
## 6949           was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he to
## 6950            defend, I to punish his conduct.  We returned unwounded, and the
## 6951                                      meeting, therefore, never got abroad.&quot;
## 6952                                                                            
## 6953        Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and a
## 6954                                     soldier she presumed not to censure it.
## 6955                                                                            
## 6956          &quot;Such,&quot; said Colonel Brandon, after a pause, &quot;has been the unhappy
## 6957     resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter! and so imperfectly
## 6958                                                have I discharged my trust!&quot;
## 6959                                                                            
## 6960                                                     &quot;Is she still in town?&quot;
## 6961                                                                            
## 6962       &quot;No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in, for I found her near
## 6963       her delivery, I removed her and her child into the country, and there
## 6964                                                               she remains.&quot;
## 6965                                                                            
## 6966         Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably dividing Elinor
## 6967       from her sister, he put an end to his visit, receiving from her again
## 6968       the same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her full of compassion
## 6969                                                         and esteem for him.
## 6970                                                                            
## 6971                                                                            
## 6972                                                                            
## 6973                                                                  CHAPTER 32
## 6974                                                                            
## 6975                                                                            
## 6976             When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss
## 6977       Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was
## 6978        not entirely such as the former had hoped to see.  Not that Marianne
## 6979       appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to
## 6980          it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither
## 6981           objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and
## 6982         seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible.  But
## 6983      though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt
## 6984          WAS carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the
## 6985     effect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,
## 6986           in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of
## 6987        compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less violently
## 6988     irritated than before, she did not see her less wretched.  Her mind did
## 6989     become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.  She felt the
## 6990       loss of Willoughby&#39;s character yet more heavily than she had felt the
## 6991        loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the
## 6992      misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE
## 6993        have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits, that
## 6994       she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor;
## 6995     and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her sister
## 6996        than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent
## 6997                                                         confession of them.
## 6998                                                                            
## 6999      To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and
## 7000        answering Elinor&#39;s letter would be only to give a repetition of what
## 7001         her daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly
## 7002          less painful than Marianne&#39;s, and an indignation even greater than
## 7003            Elinor&#39;s.  Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,
## 7004           arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her
## 7005         anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with
## 7006             fortitude under this misfortune.  Bad indeed must the nature of
## 7007          Marianne&#39;s affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude!
## 7008       mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which
## 7009                                          SHE could wish her not to indulge!
## 7010                                                                            
## 7011       Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had
## 7012         determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at
## 7013       that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be
## 7014      bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by
## 7015       constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen
## 7016          him there.  She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all
## 7017     means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which,
## 7018         though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at
## 7019      least five or six weeks.  A variety of occupations, of objects, and of
## 7020         company, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitable
## 7021        there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into some
## 7022          interest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as the
## 7023                                  ideas of both might now be spurned by her.
## 7024                                                                            
## 7025       From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her
## 7026            to be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his
## 7027           acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her
## 7028     friends.  Design could never bring them in each other&#39;s way: negligence
## 7029        could never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in
## 7030            its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of
## 7031      Barton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit at
## 7032     Allenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at first
## 7033        as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain one.
## 7034                                                                            
## 7035         She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where
## 7036        they were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his
## 7037       wife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged
## 7038                      it right that they should sometimes see their brother.
## 7039                                                                            
## 7040         Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother&#39;s opinion, and she
## 7041              submitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved
## 7042      perfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she felt
## 7043            it to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by
## 7044      requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only
## 7045      possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her
## 7046      mother, and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent
## 7047                                           her ever knowing a moment&#39;s rest.
## 7048                                                                            
## 7049     But it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what brought evil
## 7050         to herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the other
## 7051          hand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward
## 7052      entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer stay
## 7053      would therefore militate against her own happiness, it would be better
## 7054                      for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.
## 7055                                                                            
## 7056       Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby&#39;s
## 7057      name mentioned, was not thrown away.  Marianne, though without knowing
## 7058        it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor
## 7059       Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.
## 7060         Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards
## 7061         herself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day
## 7062                                   after day to the indignation of them all.
## 7063                                                                            
## 7064        Sir John, could not have thought it possible.  &quot;A man of whom he had
## 7065      always had such reason to think well!  Such a good-natured fellow!  He
## 7066             did not believe there was a bolder rider in England!  It was an
## 7067     unaccountable business.  He wished him at the devil with all his heart.
## 7068        He would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, for
## 7069      all the world!  No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert,
## 7070       and they were kept watching for two hours together.  Such a scoundrel
## 7071      of a fellow! such a deceitful dog!  It was only the last time they met
## 7072     that he had offered him one of Folly&#39;s puppies! and this was the end of
## 7073                                                                        it!&quot;
## 7074                                                                            
## 7075         Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry.  &quot;She was determined to
## 7076       drop his acquaintance immediately, and she was very thankful that she
## 7077         had never been acquainted with him at all.  She wished with all her
## 7078        heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify,
## 7079         for it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated him so much
## 7080       that she was resolved never to mention his name again, and she should
## 7081                       tell everybody she saw, how good-for-nothing he was.&quot;
## 7082                                                                            
## 7083           The rest of Mrs. Palmer&#39;s sympathy was shewn in procuring all the
## 7084     particulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and communicating
## 7085           them to Elinor.  She could soon tell at what coachmaker&#39;s the new
## 7086        carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby&#39;s portrait was
## 7087             drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey&#39;s clothes might be seen.
## 7088                                                                            
## 7089       The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a
## 7090       happy relief to Elinor&#39;s spirits, oppressed as they often were by the
## 7091      clamorous kindness of the others.  It was a great comfort to her to be
## 7092      sure of exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their circle
## 7093       of friends: a great comfort to know that there was ONE who would meet
## 7094     her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any anxiety for
## 7095                                                        her sister&#39;s health.
## 7096                                                                            
## 7097         Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the
## 7098     moment, to more than its real value; and she was sometimes worried down
## 7099      by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more indispensable to
## 7100                                                   comfort than good-nature.
## 7101                                                                            
## 7102      Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day,
## 7103        or twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, &quot;It is very
## 7104         shocking, indeed!&quot; and by the means of this continual though gentle
## 7105            vent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first
## 7106             without the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without
## 7107            recollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the
## 7108          dignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was
## 7109         wrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the
## 7110     interest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined (though rather
## 7111      against the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once
## 7112      be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her as soon
## 7113                                                             as she married.
## 7114                                                                            
## 7115      Colonel Brandon&#39;s delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome
## 7116       to Miss Dashwood.  He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate
## 7117        discussion of her sister&#39;s disappointment, by the friendly zeal with
## 7118       which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with
## 7119        confidence.  His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing
## 7120         past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye
## 7121       with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her
## 7122         voice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or
## 7123           could oblige herself to speak to him.  THESE assured him that his
## 7124         exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and
## 7125       THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; but
## 7126         Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the
## 7127      Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither prevail
## 7128         on him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make it for
## 7129               him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of
## 7130     Midsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end of
## 7131         a week that it would not be a match at all.  The good understanding
## 7132     between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the
## 7133      honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would all
## 7134         be made over to HER; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased to
## 7135                                               think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.
## 7136                                                                            
## 7137      Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby&#39;s
## 7138       letter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he
## 7139       was married.  She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to
## 7140     herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she was
## 7141       desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from
## 7142       the public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every morning.
## 7143                                                                            
## 7144       She received the news with resolute composure; made no observation on
## 7145     it, and at first shed no tears; but after a short time they would burst
## 7146            out, and for the rest of the day, she was in a state hardly less
## 7147                    pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event.
## 7148                                                                            
## 7149      The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now
## 7150         hoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them, to
## 7151      prevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow
## 7152              first fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before.
## 7153                                                                            
## 7154      About this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin&#39;s
## 7155          house in Bartlett&#39;s Buildings, Holburn, presented themselves again
## 7156      before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; and
## 7157                            were welcomed by them all with great cordiality.
## 7158                                                                            
## 7159          Elinor only was sorry to see them.  Their presence always gave her
## 7160         pain, and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the
## 7161                  overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her STILL in town.
## 7162                                                                            
## 7163          &quot;I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here
## 7164      STILL,&quot; said she repeatedly, with a strong emphasis on the word.  &quot;But
## 7165           I always thought I SHOULD.  I was almost sure you would not leave
## 7166        London yet awhile; though you TOLD me, you know, at Barton, that you
## 7167        should not stay above a MONTH.  But I thought, at the time, that you
## 7168     would most likely change your mind when it came to the point.  It would
## 7169       have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and
## 7170     sister came.  And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone.  I
## 7171                           am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD.&quot;
## 7172                                                                            
## 7173              Elinor perfectly understood her, and was forced to use all her
## 7174                            self-command to make it appear that she did NOT.
## 7175                                                                            
## 7176              &quot;Well, my dear,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, &quot;and how did you travel?&quot;
## 7177                                                                            
## 7178           &quot;Not in the stage, I assure you,&quot; replied Miss Steele, with quick
## 7179         exultation; &quot;we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to
## 7180      attend us.  Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought we&#39;d join
## 7181        him in a post-chaise; and he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or
## 7182                                         twelve shillings more than we did.&quot;
## 7183                                                                            
## 7184      &quot;Oh, oh!&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings; &quot;very pretty, indeed! and the Doctor is
## 7185                                               a single man, I warrant you.&quot;
## 7186                                                                            
## 7187      &quot;There now,&quot; said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering, &quot;everybody laughs
## 7188     at me so about the Doctor, and I cannot think why.  My cousins say they
## 7189          are sure I have made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never
## 7190     think about him from one hour&#39;s end to another.  &#39;Lord! here comes your
## 7191     beau, Nancy,&#39; my cousin said t&#39;other day, when she saw him crossing the
## 7192       street to the house.  My beau, indeed! said I--I cannot think who you
## 7193                                      mean.  The Doctor is no beau of mine.&quot;
## 7194                                                                            
## 7195      &quot;Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--but it won&#39;t do--the Doctor is
## 7196                                                            the man, I see.&quot;
## 7197                                                                            
## 7198     &quot;No, indeed!&quot; replied her cousin, with affected earnestness, &quot;and I beg
## 7199                     you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of.&quot;
## 7200                                                                            
## 7201           Mrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she
## 7202             certainly would NOT, and Miss Steele was made completely happy.
## 7203                                                                            
## 7204          &quot;I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, Miss
## 7205            Dashwood, when they come to town,&quot; said Lucy, returning, after a
## 7206                                  cessation of hostile hints, to the charge.
## 7207                                                                            
## 7208                                              &quot;No, I do not think we shall.&quot;
## 7209                                                                            
## 7210                                             &quot;Oh, yes, I dare say you will.&quot;
## 7211                                                                            
## 7212                          Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition.
## 7213                                                                            
## 7214      &quot;What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for
## 7215                                                   so long a time together!&quot;
## 7216                                                                            
## 7217      &quot;Long a time, indeed!&quot; interposed Mrs. Jennings.  &quot;Why, their visit is
## 7218                                                            but just begun!&quot;
## 7219                                                                            
## 7220                                                          Lucy was silenced.
## 7221                                                                            
## 7222            &quot;I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood,&quot; said Miss
## 7223      Steele.  &quot;I am sorry she is not well--&quot; for Marianne had left the room
## 7224                                                           on their arrival.
## 7225                                                                            
## 7226            &quot;You are very good.  My sister will be equally sorry to miss the
## 7227      pleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with
## 7228      nervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation.&quot;
## 7229                                                                            
## 7230           &quot;Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and
## 7231    me!--I think she might see US; and I am sure we would not speak a word.&quot;
## 7232                                                                            
## 7233         Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal.  Her sister was
## 7234      perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore
## 7235                                                   not able to come to them.
## 7236                                                                            
## 7237     &quot;Oh, if that&#39;s all,&quot; cried Miss Steele, &quot;we can just as well go and see
## 7238                                                                       HER.&quot;
## 7239                                                                            
## 7240     Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper; but she
## 7241      was saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucy&#39;s sharp reprimand, which
## 7242     now, as on many occasions, though it did not give much sweetness to the
## 7243    manners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of the other.
## 7244                                                                            
## 7245                                                                            
## 7246                                                                            
## 7247                                                                  CHAPTER 33
## 7248                                                                            
## 7249                                                                            
## 7250     After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister&#39;s entreaties, and
## 7251      consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an
## 7252         hour. She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, and
## 7253         would do no more than accompany them to Gray&#39;s in Sackville Street,
## 7254        where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few
## 7255                                         old-fashioned jewels of her mother.
## 7256                                                                            
## 7257     When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was
## 7258     a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call; and as
## 7259        she had no business at Gray&#39;s, it was resolved, that while her young
## 7260         friends transacted their&#39;s, she should pay her visit and return for
## 7261                                                                       them.
## 7262                                                                            
## 7263     On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before
## 7264         them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend to
## 7265        their orders; and they were obliged to wait.  All that could be done
## 7266     was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the
## 7267       quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is
## 7268     probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to
## 7269       a quicker despatch.  But the correctness of his eye, and the delicacy
## 7270     of his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness.  He was giving orders
## 7271             for a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size, shape, and
## 7272       ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining and debating
## 7273        for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop, were
## 7274           finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no leisure to
## 7275       bestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was comprised
## 7276        in three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which served to
## 7277          imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong,
## 7278      natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first style of
## 7279                                                                    fashion.
## 7280                                                                            
## 7281           Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and
## 7282       resentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on
## 7283      the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of
## 7284     the different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining
## 7285     unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts
## 7286       within herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing around her, in
## 7287                                     Mr. Gray&#39;s shop, as in her own bedroom.
## 7288                                                                            
## 7289       At last the affair was decided.  The ivory, the gold, and the pearls,
## 7290     all received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the last
## 7291     day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of
## 7292             the toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care, and
## 7293           bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a one as
## 7294          seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off with a
## 7295                        happy air of real conceit and affected indifference.
## 7296                                                                            
## 7297      Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point
## 7298     of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her side.
## 7299      She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some surprise
## 7300                                                          to be her brother.
## 7301                                                                            
## 7302      Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very
## 7303     creditable appearance in Mr. Gray&#39;s shop.  John Dashwood was really far
## 7304              from being sorry to see his sisters again; it rather gave them
## 7305      satisfaction; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and
## 7306                                                                  attentive.
## 7307                                                                            
## 7308                   Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days.
## 7309                                                                            
## 7310       &quot;I wished very much to call upon you yesterday,&quot; said he, &quot;but it was
## 7311     impossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at
## 7312        Exeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars.
## 7313     Harry was vastly pleased.  THIS morning I had fully intended to call on
## 7314      you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always so
## 7315      much to do on first coming to town.  I am come here to bespeak Fanny a
## 7316            seal.  But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in
## 7317         Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings.  I
## 7318         understand she is a woman of very good fortune.  And the Middletons
## 7319     too, you must introduce me to THEM.  As my mother-in-law&#39;s relations, I
## 7320              shall be happy to show them every respect.  They are excellent
## 7321                            neighbours to you in the country, I understand.&quot;
## 7322                                                                            
## 7323      &quot;Excellent indeed.  Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness
## 7324                           in every particular, is more than I can express.&quot;
## 7325                                                                            
## 7326       &quot;I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word; extremely glad indeed.
## 7327           But so it ought to be; they are people of large fortune, they are
## 7328      related to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve to
## 7329      make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected.  And so you
## 7330            are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for
## 7331       nothing!  Edward brought us a most charming account of the place: the
## 7332        most complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was, and you all
## 7333     seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing.  It was a great satisfaction to us
## 7334                                                  to hear it, I assure you.&quot;
## 7335                                                                            
## 7336       Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother; and was not sorry to
## 7337            be spared the necessity of answering him, by the arrival of Mrs.
## 7338       Jennings&#39;s servant, who came to tell her that his mistress waited for
## 7339                                                           them at the door.
## 7340                                                                            
## 7341     Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings
## 7342        at the door of her carriage, and repeating his hope of being able to
## 7343                                      call on them the next day, took leave.
## 7344                                                                            
## 7345        His visit was duly paid.  He came with a pretence at an apology from
## 7346       their sister-in-law, for not coming too; &quot;but she was so much engaged
## 7347       with her mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where.&quot;
## 7348     Mrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not stand
## 7349     upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like it, and she
## 7350        should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring her
## 7351       sisters to see her.  His manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectly
## 7352              kind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel
## 7353        Brandon&#39;s coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a curiosity
## 7354      which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be rich, to be
## 7355                                                       equally civil to HIM.
## 7356                                                                            
## 7357      After staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him
## 7358        to Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.
## 7359     The weather was remarkably fine, and she readily consented.  As soon as
## 7360                            they were out of the house, his enquiries began.
## 7361                                                                            
## 7362                          &quot;Who is Colonel Brandon?  Is he a man of fortune?&quot;
## 7363                                                                            
## 7364                            &quot;Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire.&quot;
## 7365                                                                            
## 7366          &quot;I am glad of it.  He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think,
## 7367        Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable
## 7368                                                     establishment in life.&quot;
## 7369                                                                            
## 7370                                            &quot;Me, brother! what do you mean?&quot;
## 7371                                                                            
## 7372      &quot;He likes you.  I observed him narrowly, and am convinced of it.  What
## 7373                                              is the amount of his fortune?&quot;
## 7374                                                                            
## 7375                                      &quot;I believe about two thousand a year.&quot;
## 7376                                                                            
## 7377            &quot;Two thousand a-year;&quot; and then working himself up to a pitch of
## 7378     enthusiastic generosity, he added, &quot;Elinor, I wish with all my heart it
## 7379                                         were TWICE as much, for your sake.&quot;
## 7380                                                                            
## 7381            &quot;Indeed I believe you,&quot; replied Elinor; &quot;but I am very sure that
## 7382                  Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME.&quot;
## 7383                                                                            
## 7384       &quot;You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken.  A very little
## 7385        trouble on your side secures him.  Perhaps just at present he may be
## 7386        undecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; his
## 7387            friends may all advise him against it.  But some of those little
## 7388      attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix
## 7389        him, in spite of himself.  And there can be no reason why you should
## 7390     not try for him.  It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on
## 7391       your side--in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is
## 7392      quite out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--you have
## 7393       too much sense not to see all that.  Colonel Brandon must be the man;
## 7394        and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with
## 7395                you and your family.  It is a match that must give universal
## 7396          satisfaction.  In short, it is a kind of thing that&quot;--lowering his
## 7397          voice to an important whisper--&quot;will be exceedingly welcome to ALL
## 7398      PARTIES.&quot; Recollecting himself, however, he added, &quot;That is, I mean to
## 7399      say--your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled; Fanny
## 7400        particularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I assure
## 7401     you.  And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am
## 7402     sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much the other day.&quot;
## 7403                                                                            
## 7404                                      Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.
## 7405                                                                            
## 7406           &quot;It would be something remarkable, now,&quot; he continued, &quot;something
## 7407        droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the
## 7408                               same time.  And yet it is not very unlikely.&quot;
## 7409                                                                            
## 7410         &quot;Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,&quot; said Elinor, with resolution, &quot;going to be
## 7411                                                                   married?&quot;
## 7412                                                                            
## 7413        &quot;It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation.
## 7414              He has a most excellent mother.  Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost
## 7415      liberality, will come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, if
## 7416     the match takes place.  The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter
## 7417     of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds.  A very desirable
## 7418     connection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place in
## 7419      time.  A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away, to
## 7420       make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit.  To give you
## 7421      another instance of her liberality:--The other day, as soon as we came
## 7422        to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now,
## 7423          she put bank-notes into Fanny&#39;s hands to the amount of two hundred
## 7424        pounds.  And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great
## 7425                                                 expense while we are here.&quot;
## 7426                                                                            
## 7427     He paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to say,
## 7428                                                                            
## 7429     &quot;Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable;
## 7430                                            but your income is a large one.&quot;
## 7431                                                                            
## 7432        &quot;Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose.  I do not mean to
## 7433     complain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope will
## 7434       in time be better.  The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on,
## 7435     is a most serious drain.  And then I have made a little purchase within
## 7436       this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place, where
## 7437          old Gibson used to live.  The land was so very desirable for me in
## 7438     every respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it
## 7439        my duty to buy it.  I could not have answered it to my conscience to
## 7440      let it fall into any other hands.  A man must pay for his convenience;
## 7441                                   and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money.&quot;
## 7442                                                                            
## 7443                    &quot;More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.&quot;
## 7444                                                                            
## 7445       &quot;Why, I hope not that.  I might have sold it again, the next day, for
## 7446      more than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have
## 7447      been very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,
## 7448         that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker&#39;s
## 7449                            hands, I must have sold out to very great loss.&quot;
## 7450                                                                            
## 7451                                                    Elinor could only smile.
## 7452                                                                            
## 7453     &quot;Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to
## 7454        Norland.  Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the
## 7455     Stanhill effects that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)
## 7456     to your mother.  Far be it from me to repine at his doing so; he had an
## 7457         undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose, but, in
## 7458          consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large purchases of
## 7459      linen, china, &amp;c. to supply the place of what was taken away.  You may
## 7460         guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be from being
## 7461                       rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s kindness is.&quot;
## 7462                                                                            
## 7463       &quot;Certainly,&quot; said Elinor; &quot;and assisted by her liberality, I hope you
## 7464                                  may yet live to be in easy circumstances.&quot;
## 7465                                                                            
## 7466      &quot;Another year or two may do much towards it,&quot; he gravely replied; &quot;but
## 7467       however there is still a great deal to be done.  There is not a stone
## 7468                laid of Fanny&#39;s green-house, and nothing but the plan of the
## 7469                                                  flower-garden marked out.&quot;
## 7470                                                                            
## 7471                                           &quot;Where is the green-house to be?&quot;
## 7472                                                                            
## 7473        &quot;Upon the knoll behind the house.  The old walnut trees are all come
## 7474          down to make room for it.  It will be a very fine object from many
## 7475        parts of the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just before
## 7476     it, and be exceedingly pretty.  We have cleared away all the old thorns
## 7477                                        that grew in patches over the brow.&quot;
## 7478                                                                            
## 7479            Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself; and was very
## 7480           thankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.
## 7481                                                                            
## 7482        Having now said enough to make his poverty clear, and to do away the
## 7483     necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters, in his
## 7484     next visit at Gray&#39;s his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he began
## 7485            to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.
## 7486                                                                            
## 7487            &quot;She seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her house, her style of
## 7488     living, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an acquaintance
## 7489     that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may
## 7490     prove materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is certainly a
## 7491      vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks altogether so great a
## 7492       regard for you, that in all probability when she dies you will not be
## 7493                          forgotten.-- She must have a great deal to leave.&quot;
## 7494                                                                            
## 7495              &quot;Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has only her
## 7496                              jointure, which will descend to her children.&quot;
## 7497                                                                            
## 7498         &quot;But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income.  Few
## 7499         people of common prudence will do THAT; and whatever she saves, she
## 7500                                                will be able to dispose of.&quot;
## 7501                                                                            
## 7502        &quot;And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her
## 7503                                                     daughters, than to us?&quot;
## 7504                                                                            
## 7505           &quot;Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I
## 7506              cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther.
## 7507            Whereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, and
## 7508      treating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on
## 7509             her future consideration, which a conscientious woman would not
## 7510           disregard.  Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour; and she can
## 7511      hardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises.&quot;
## 7512                                                                            
## 7513        &quot;But she raises none in those most concerned.  Indeed, brother, your
## 7514                anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far.&quot;
## 7515                                                                            
## 7516      &quot;Why, to be sure,&quot; said he, seeming to recollect himself, &quot;people have
## 7517      little, have very little in their power.  But, my dear Elinor, what is
## 7518     the matter with Marianne?-- she looks very unwell, has lost her colour,
## 7519                                      and is grown quite thin.  Is she ill?&quot;
## 7520                                                                            
## 7521        &quot;She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several
## 7522                                                                     weeks.&quot;
## 7523                                                                            
## 7524         &quot;I am sorry for that.  At her time of life, any thing of an illness
## 7525      destroys the bloom for ever!  Hers has been a very short one!  She was
## 7526          as handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to
## 7527     attract the man.  There was something in her style of beauty, to please
## 7528       them particularly.  I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry
## 7529     sooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly fond of
## 7530      YOU, but so it happened to strike her.  She will be mistaken, however.
## 7531      I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth more than five
## 7532        or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if
## 7533     YOU do not do better.  Dorsetshire!  I know very little of Dorsetshire;
## 7534        but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;
## 7535         and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the
## 7536                                earliest and best pleased of your visitors.&quot;
## 7537                                                                            
## 7538               Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no
## 7539       likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation
## 7540       of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really
## 7541      resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the
## 7542       marriage by every possible attention.  He had just compunction enough
## 7543          for having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly
## 7544       anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from
## 7545      Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means
## 7546                                             of atoning for his own neglect.
## 7547                                                                            
## 7548         They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John
## 7549        came in before their visit ended.  Abundance of civilities passed on
## 7550     all sides.  Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood
## 7551      did not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very
## 7552      good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his
## 7553         appearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood
## 7554                                              went away delighted with both.
## 7555                                                                            
## 7556         &quot;I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny,&quot; said he, as he
## 7557      walked back with his sister.  &quot;Lady Middleton is really a most elegant
## 7558     woman!  Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know.  And Mrs.
## 7559      Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegant
## 7560             as her daughter.  Your sister need not have any scruple even of
## 7561      visiting HER, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, and
## 7562      very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a
## 7563      man who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars
## 7564         were both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her daughters
## 7565     were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with.  But now
## 7566                       I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both.&quot;
## 7567                                                                            
## 7568                                                                            
## 7569                                                                            
## 7570                                                                  CHAPTER 34
## 7571                                                                            
## 7572                                                                            
## 7573        Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband&#39;s judgment,
## 7574             that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her
## 7575       daughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,
## 7576     even the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means unworthy
## 7577        her notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of the most
## 7578                                                charming women in the world!
## 7579                                                                            
## 7580         Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood.  There was a
## 7581              kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually
## 7582          attracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid
## 7583                 propriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding.
## 7584                                                                            
## 7585      The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the
## 7586     good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings,
## 7587      and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking woman
## 7588             of uncordial address, who met her husband&#39;s sisters without any
## 7589        affection, and almost without having anything to say to them; for of
## 7590        the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she sat at least
## 7591                                        seven minutes and a half in silence.
## 7592                                                                            
## 7593           Elinor wanted very much to know, though she did not chuse to ask,
## 7594       whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny
## 7595      voluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that
## 7596        his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband&#39;s
## 7597         expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed
## 7598      them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be
## 7599             too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.  The
## 7600            intelligence however, which SHE would not give, soon flowed from
## 7601       another quarter.  Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor&#39;s compassion
## 7602       on being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr.
## 7603      and Mrs. Dashwood.  He dared not come to Bartlett&#39;s Buildings for fear
## 7604     of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to be
## 7605                           told, they could do nothing at present but write.
## 7606                                                                            
## 7607       Edward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short
## 7608     time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street.  Twice was his card found on
## 7609     the table, when they returned from their morning&#39;s engagements.  Elinor
## 7610         was pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had
## 7611                                                                 missed him.
## 7612                                                                            
## 7613     The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons, that,
## 7614         though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined to
## 7615       give them--a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began, invited
## 7616       them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very good house
## 7617             for three months.  Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited
## 7618     likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who,
## 7619         always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager
## 7620        civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.  They were to
## 7621      meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to
## 7622     be of the party.  The expectation of seeing HER, however, was enough to
## 7623        make her interested in the engagement; for though she could now meet
## 7624      Edward&#39;s mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to
## 7625      attend such an introduction, though she could now see her with perfect
## 7626           indifference as to her opinion of herself, her desire of being in
## 7627     company with Mrs. Ferrars, her curiosity to know what she was like, was
## 7628                                                          as lively as ever.
## 7629                                                                            
## 7630            The interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon
## 7631       afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing
## 7632                                that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.
## 7633                                                                            
## 7634     So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so agreeable
## 7635      had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was certainly
## 7636        not so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as ready as
## 7637       Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street; and it
## 7638      happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, as soon as
## 7639        the Dashwoods&#39; invitation was known, that their visit should begin a
## 7640                                       few days before the party took place.
## 7641                                                                            
## 7642      Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of the
## 7643     gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother, might not
## 7644     have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her table; but
## 7645     as Lady Middleton&#39;s guests they must be welcome; and Lucy, who had long
## 7646       wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a nearer view of
## 7647       their characters and her own difficulties, and to have an opportunity
## 7648        of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier in her life,
## 7649                        than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood&#39;s card.
## 7650                                                                            
## 7651          On Elinor its effect was very different.  She began immediately to
## 7652      determine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as his
## 7653          mother was, to a party given by his sister; and to see him for the
## 7654      first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardly
## 7655                                                 knew how she could bear it!
## 7656                                                                            
## 7657      These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and
## 7658      certainly not at all on truth.  They were relieved however, not by her
## 7659     own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to
## 7660         be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward
## 7661       certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to
## 7662       be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept
## 7663       away by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal
## 7664                                                    when they were together.
## 7665                                                                            
## 7666       The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies
## 7667                                           to this formidable mother-in-law.
## 7668                                                                            
## 7669      &quot;Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!&quot; said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs
## 7670       together--for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings,
## 7671       that they all followed the servant at the same time--&quot;There is nobody
## 7672          here but you, that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand.
## 7673              Good gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all my
## 7674                           happiness depends on--that is to be my mother!&quot;--
## 7675                                                                            
## 7676              Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the
## 7677         possibility of its being Miss Morton&#39;s mother, rather than her own,
## 7678      whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured
## 7679          her, and with great sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter
## 7680       amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at
## 7681                      least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.
## 7682                                                                            
## 7683       Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in
## 7684              her figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect.  Her
## 7685          complexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, and
## 7686       naturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had
## 7687       rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it
## 7688      the strong characters of pride and ill nature.  She was not a woman of
## 7689     many words; for, unlike people in general, she proportioned them to the
## 7690      number of her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her, not
## 7691     one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed with the spirited
## 7692                               determination of disliking her at all events.
## 7693                                                                            
## 7694      Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.-- A few months
## 7695     ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars&#39;
## 7696      power to distress her by it now;--and the difference of her manners to
## 7697        the Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made to humble
## 7698              her more, only amused her.  She could not but smile to see the
## 7699      graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person-- for
## 7700     Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others, had they known
## 7701     as much as she did, they would have been most anxious to mortify; while
## 7702              she herself, who had comparatively no power to wound them, sat
## 7703      pointedly slighted by both.  But while she smiled at a graciousness so
## 7704     misapplied, she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which
## 7705           it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss
## 7706      Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly despising them all
## 7707                                                                       four.
## 7708                                                                            
## 7709       Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss
## 7710     Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy.
## 7711                                                                            
## 7712     The dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every thing
## 7713       bespoke the Mistress&#39;s inclination for show, and the Master&#39;s ability
## 7714       to support it.  In spite of the improvements and additions which were
## 7715         making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner having once
## 7716          been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a
## 7717      loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to
## 7718             infer from it;--no poverty of any kind, except of conversation,
## 7719        appeared--but there, the deficiency was considerable.  John Dashwood
## 7720        had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing, and his wife
## 7721     had still less.  But there was no peculiar disgrace in this; for it was
## 7722         very much the case with the chief of their visitors, who almost all
## 7723            laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being
## 7724               agreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want of
## 7725                               elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.
## 7726                                                                            
## 7727     When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this poverty
## 7728      was particularly evident, for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse
## 7729             with some variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land, and
## 7730     breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one subject only engaged
## 7731        the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative heights of
## 7732           Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton&#39;s second son William, who were
## 7733                                                     nearly of the same age.
## 7734                                                                            
## 7735     Had both the children been there, the affair might have been determined
## 7736     too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was present, it
## 7737     was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every body had a right
## 7738     to be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it over and over
## 7739                                               again as often as they liked.
## 7740                                                                            
## 7741                                                     The parties stood thus:
## 7742                                                                            
## 7743      The two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was the
## 7744                           tallest, politely decided in favour of the other.
## 7745                                                                            
## 7746         The two grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity,
## 7747                    were equally earnest in support of their own descendant.
## 7748                                                                            
## 7749      Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other,
## 7750     thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could not
## 7751           conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world
## 7752         between them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as
## 7753                                       fast as she could, in favour of each.
## 7754                                                                            
## 7755       Elinor, having once delivered her opinion on William&#39;s side, by which
## 7756             she offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the
## 7757      necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when
## 7758         called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she had no
## 7759                         opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.
## 7760                                                                            
## 7761     Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair
## 7762          of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted and
## 7763       brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens,
## 7764      catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen
## 7765        into the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for
## 7766                                                             his admiration.
## 7767                                                                            
## 7768        &quot;These are done by my eldest sister,&quot; said he; &quot;and you, as a man of
## 7769       taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them.  I do not know whether
## 7770       you have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but she
## 7771                             is in general reckoned to draw extremely well.&quot;
## 7772                                                                            
## 7773         The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,
## 7774      warmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by
## 7775           Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course
## 7776      excited, they were handed round for general inspection.  Mrs. Ferrars,
## 7777      not aware of their being Elinor&#39;s work, particularly requested to look
## 7778           at them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady
## 7779               Middletons&#39;s approbation, Fanny presented them to her mother,
## 7780       considerately informing her, at the same time, that they were done by
## 7781                                                              Miss Dashwood.
## 7782                                                                            
## 7783     &quot;Hum&quot;--said Mrs. Ferrars--&quot;very pretty,&quot;--and without regarding them at
## 7784                                         all, returned them to her daughter.
## 7785                                                                            
## 7786      Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude
## 7787                     enough,--for, colouring a little, she immediately said,
## 7788                                                                            
## 7789      &quot;They are very pretty, ma&#39;am--an&#39;t they?&quot; But then again, the dread of
## 7790     having been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over her,
## 7791                                                    for she presently added,
## 7792                                                                            
## 7793              &quot;Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton&#39;s style of
## 7794        painting, Ma&#39;am?--She DOES paint most delightfully!--How beautifully
## 7795                                                her last landscape is done!&quot;
## 7796                                                                            
## 7797                       &quot;Beautifully indeed!  But SHE does every thing well.&quot;
## 7798                                                                            
## 7799      Marianne could not bear this.--She was already greatly displeased with
## 7800             Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor&#39;s
## 7801     expense, though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by
## 7802                            it, provoked her immediately to say with warmth,
## 7803                                                                            
## 7804      &quot;This is admiration of a very particular kind!--what is Miss Morton to
## 7805       us?--who knows, or who cares, for her?--it is Elinor of whom WE think
## 7806                                                                 and speak.&quot;
## 7807                                                                            
## 7808       And so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law&#39;s hands,
## 7809                         to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.
## 7810                                                                            
## 7811          Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more
## 7812        stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, &quot;Miss
## 7813                                          Morton is Lord Morton&#39;s daughter.&quot;
## 7814                                                                            
## 7815     Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at his
## 7816     sister&#39;s audacity.  Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne&#39;s warmth than
## 7817       she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon&#39;s eyes, as they
## 7818      were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was amiable
## 7819          in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister
## 7820                                             slighted in the smallest point.
## 7821                                                                            
## 7822          Marianne&#39;s feelings did not stop here.  The cold insolence of Mrs.
## 7823      Ferrars&#39;s general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell
## 7824        such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart
## 7825        taught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of
## 7826         affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister&#39;s
## 7827     chair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to hers,
## 7828                                            said in a low, but eager, voice,
## 7829                                                                            
## 7830     &quot;Dear, dear Elinor, don&#39;t mind them.  Don&#39;t let them make YOU unhappy.&quot;
## 7831                                                                            
## 7832      She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her
## 7833              face on Elinor&#39;s shoulder, she burst into tears.  Every body&#39;s
## 7834         attention was called, and almost every body was concerned.--Colonel
## 7835         Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did.--Mrs.
## 7836     Jennings, with a very intelligent &quot;Ah! poor dear,&quot; immediately gave her
## 7837      her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author
## 7838         of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to one
## 7839        close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of
## 7840                                                  the whole shocking affair.
## 7841                                                                            
## 7842      In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end
## 7843     to the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits retained
## 7844                       the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.
## 7845                                                                            
## 7846       &quot;Poor Marianne!&quot; said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,
## 7847          as soon as he could secure his attention,-- &quot;She has not such good
## 7848           health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor&#39;s
## 7849       constitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying
## 7850          to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal
## 7851              attractions.  You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS
## 7852        remarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.--
## 7853                                                Now you see it is all gone.&quot;
## 7854                                                                            
## 7855                                                                            
## 7856                                                                            
## 7857                                                                  CHAPTER 35
## 7858                                                                            
## 7859                                                                            
## 7860       Elinor&#39;s curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.-- She had found
## 7861     in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between
## 7862           the families undesirable.-- She had seen enough of her pride, her
## 7863       meanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend
## 7864           all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and
## 7865         retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise
## 7866      free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake,
## 7867      that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other
## 7868      of Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s creation, preserved her from all dependence upon her
## 7869       caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion.  Or at least, if she
## 7870        did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward&#39;s being fettered to
## 7871         Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she OUGHT to
## 7872                                                              have rejoiced.
## 7873                                                                            
## 7874      She wondered that Lucy&#39;s spirits could be so very much elevated by the
## 7875       civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so
## 7876     very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her
## 7877     because she was NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself--or to allow
## 7878       her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her, because
## 7879      her real situation was unknown.  But that it was so, had not only been
## 7880        declared by Lucy&#39;s eyes at the time, but was declared over again the
## 7881      next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady Middleton
## 7882       set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone,
## 7883                                              to tell her how happy she was.
## 7884                                                                            
## 7885          The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon
## 7886                              after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.
## 7887                                                                            
## 7888        &quot;My dear friend,&quot; cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, &quot;I
## 7889       come to talk to you of my happiness.  Could anything be so flattering
## 7890       as Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s way of treating me yesterday?  So exceeding affable
## 7891        as she was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;--but
## 7892       the very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her
## 7893       behaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy to
## 7894      me.  Now was not it so?-- You saw it all; and was not you quite struck
## 7895                                                                   with it?&quot;
## 7896                                                                            
## 7897                                      &quot;She was certainly very civil to you.&quot;
## 7898                                                                            
## 7899         &quot;Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?-- I saw a vast deal
## 7900      more.  Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride,
## 7901                no hauteur, and your sister just the same--all sweetness and
## 7902                                                                affability!&quot;
## 7903                                                                            
## 7904      Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her to
## 7905     own that she had reason for her happiness; and Elinor was obliged to go
## 7906                                                                       on.--
## 7907                                                                            
## 7908        &quot;Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,&quot; said she, &quot;nothing
## 7909      could be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was
## 7910                                                             not the case&quot;--
## 7911                                                                            
## 7912      &quot;I guessed you would say so,&quot;--replied Lucy quickly--&quot;but there was no
## 7913     reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she did
## 7914        not, and her liking me is every thing.  You shan&#39;t talk me out of my
## 7915         satisfaction.  I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no
## 7916            difficulties at all, to what I used to think.  Mrs. Ferrars is a
## 7917     charming woman, and so is your sister.  They are both delightful women,
## 7918            indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs.
## 7919                                                              Dashwood was!&quot;
## 7920                                                                            
## 7921              To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.
## 7922                                                                            
## 7923      &quot;Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you seem low--you don&#39;t speak;--sure you
## 7924                                                                 an&#39;t well.&quot;
## 7925                                                                            
## 7926                                             &quot;I never was in better health.&quot;
## 7927                                                                            
## 7928      &quot;I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it.  I
## 7929           should be sorry to have YOU ill; you, that have been the greatest
## 7930           comfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have done
## 7931                                                 without your friendship.&quot;--
## 7932                                                                            
## 7933       Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success.
## 7934                    But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she directly replied,
## 7935                                                                            
## 7936         &quot;Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to
## 7937        Edward&#39;s love, it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But
## 7938      now there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty
## 7939       often, for Lady Middleton&#39;s delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall
## 7940     be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half his
## 7941         time with his sister--besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will
## 7942       visit now;--and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say
## 7943       more than once, they should always be glad to see me.-- They are such
## 7944     charming women!--I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of
## 7945                                            her, you cannot speak too high.&quot;
## 7946                                                                            
## 7947     But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she SHOULD
## 7948                                           tell her sister.  Lucy continued.
## 7949                                                                            
## 7950      &quot;I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had took
## 7951            a dislike to me.  If she had only made me a formal courtesy, for
## 7952     instance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice of
## 7953      me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know what I mean--if
## 7954       I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should have gave
## 7955       it all up in despair.  I could not have stood it.  For where she DOES
## 7956                                        dislike, I know it is most violent.&quot;
## 7957                                                                            
## 7958        Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by
## 7959     the door&#39;s being thrown open, the servant&#39;s announcing Mr. Ferrars, and
## 7960                                            Edward&#39;s immediately walking in.
## 7961                                                                            
## 7962       It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each shewed that
## 7963       it was so.  They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed to
## 7964           have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to
## 7965       advance farther into it.  The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest
## 7966     form, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had fallen
## 7967          on them.--They were not only all three together, but were together
## 7968               without the relief of any other person.  The ladies recovered
## 7969       themselves first.  It was not Lucy&#39;s business to put herself forward,
## 7970             and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up.  She could
## 7971      therefore only LOOK her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him,
## 7972                                                               said no more.
## 7973                                                                            
## 7974     But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and her
## 7975               own, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment&#39;s
## 7976       recollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost
## 7977           easy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still
## 7978           improved them.  She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the
## 7979          consciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her from
## 7980            saying that she was happy to see him, and that she had very much
## 7981        regretted being from home, when he called before in Berkeley Street.
## 7982      She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, as
## 7983      a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes of
## 7984           Lucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.
## 7985                                                                            
## 7986     Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage enough
## 7987     to sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in
## 7988      a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his sex might
## 7989         make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy&#39;s, nor
## 7990                       could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor&#39;s.
## 7991                                                                            
## 7992           Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no
## 7993        contribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word;
## 7994        and almost every thing that WAS said, proceeded from Elinor, who was
## 7995         obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother&#39;s health,
## 7996        their coming to town, &amp;c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,
## 7997                                                              but never did.
## 7998                                                                            
## 7999       Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herself
## 8000          so heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching
## 8001     Marianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it, and
## 8002     THAT in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several minutes on
## 8003     the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude, before she went
## 8004       to her sister.  When that was once done, however, it was time for the
## 8005        raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne&#39;s joy hurried her into the
## 8006        drawing-room immediately.  Her pleasure in seeing him was like every
## 8007      other of her feelings, strong in itself, and strongly spoken.  She met
## 8008         him with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed the
## 8009                                                      affection of a sister.
## 8010                                                                            
## 8011       &quot;Dear Edward!&quot; she cried, &quot;this is a moment of great happiness!--This
## 8012                                  would almost make amends for every thing!&quot;
## 8013                                                                            
## 8014         Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such
## 8015        witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt.  Again they all
## 8016       sat down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was
## 8017          looking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and
## 8018       sometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other
## 8019       should be checked by Lucy&#39;s unwelcome presence.  Edward was the first
## 8020        to speak, and it was to notice Marianne&#39;s altered looks, and express
## 8021                          his fear of her not finding London agree with her.
## 8022                                                                            
## 8023      &quot;Oh, don&#39;t think of me!&quot; she replied with spirited earnestness, though
## 8024            her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, &quot;don&#39;t think of MY
## 8025        health.  Elinor is well, you see.  That must be enough for us both.&quot;
## 8026                                                                            
## 8027      This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor
## 8028      to conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no
## 8029                                                  very benignant expression.
## 8030                                                                            
## 8031      &quot;Do you like London?&quot; said Edward, willing to say any thing that might
## 8032                                                  introduce another subject.
## 8033                                                                            
## 8034        &quot;Not at all.  I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none.
## 8035          The sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; and
## 8036                                thank Heaven! you are what you always were!&quot;
## 8037                                                                            
## 8038                                                   She paused--no one spoke.
## 8039                                                                            
## 8040      &quot;I think, Elinor,&quot; she presently added, &quot;we must employ Edward to take
## 8041        care of us in our return to Barton.  In a week or two, I suppose, we
## 8042          shall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to
## 8043                                                         accept the charge.&quot;
## 8044                                                                            
## 8045      Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even
## 8046       himself.  But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily trace
## 8047     it to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied, and
## 8048                                              soon talked of something else.
## 8049                                                                            
## 8050      &quot;We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday!  So dull, so
## 8051         wretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head, which
## 8052                                                        cannot be said now.&quot;
## 8053                                                                            
## 8054       And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her
## 8055      finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her
## 8056        being particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in
## 8057                                                                    private.
## 8058                                                                            
## 8059                &quot;But why were you not there, Edward?--Why did you not come?&quot;
## 8060                                                                            
## 8061                                                  &quot;I was engaged elsewhere.&quot;
## 8062                                                                            
## 8063            &quot;Engaged!  But what was that, when such friends were to be met?&quot;
## 8064                                                                            
## 8065         &quot;Perhaps, Miss Marianne,&quot; cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on
## 8066     her, &quot;you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have no
## 8067                                mind to keep them, little as well as great.&quot;
## 8068                                                                            
## 8069       Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the
## 8070                                              sting; for she calmly replied,
## 8071                                                                            
## 8072               &quot;Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that
## 8073       conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street.  And I really believe
## 8074       he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulous
## 8075     in performing every engagement, however minute, and however it may make
## 8076         against his interest or pleasure.  He is the most fearful of giving
## 8077     pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish,
## 8078        of any body I ever saw.  Edward, it is so, and I will say it.  What!
## 8079      are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you must be no friend of
## 8080       mine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to
## 8081                                                      my open commendation.&quot;
## 8082                                                                            
## 8083      The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened
## 8084          to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her
## 8085       auditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon
## 8086                                                          got up to go away.
## 8087                                                                            
## 8088         &quot;Going so soon!&quot; said Marianne; &quot;my dear Edward, this must not be.&quot;
## 8089                                                                            
## 8090      And drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucy
## 8091     could not stay much longer.  But even this encouragement failed, for he
## 8092       would go; and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted
## 8093                                       two hours, soon afterwards went away.
## 8094                                                                            
## 8095     &quot;What can bring her here so often?&quot; said Marianne, on her leaving them.
## 8096        &quot;Could not she see that we wanted her gone!--how teazing to Edward!&quot;
## 8097                                                                            
## 8098      &quot;Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest known
## 8099         to him of any.  It is but natural that he should like to see her as
## 8100                                                         well as ourselves.&quot;
## 8101                                                                            
## 8102     Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, &quot;You know, Elinor, that this
## 8103         is a kind of talking which I cannot bear.  If you only hope to have
## 8104          your assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, you
## 8105      ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it.  I
## 8106         cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not really
## 8107                                                                    wanted.&quot;
## 8108                                                                            
## 8109        She then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more,
## 8110      for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could give
## 8111             no information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the
## 8112          consequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she was
## 8113          obliged to submit to it.  All that she could hope, was that Edward
## 8114            would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing
## 8115      Marianne&#39;s mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of
## 8116     the pain that had attended their recent meeting--and this she had every
## 8117                                                           reason to expect.
## 8118                                                                            
## 8119                                                                            
## 8120                                                                            
## 8121                                                                  CHAPTER 36
## 8122                                                                            
## 8123                                                                            
## 8124       Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the
## 8125       world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a
## 8126       son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least
## 8127                       to all those intimate connections who knew it before.
## 8128                                                                            
## 8129       This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings&#39;s happiness, produced a
## 8130      temporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a
## 8131     like degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished to
## 8132    be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning as
## 8133       soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in the evening;
## 8134        and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the Middletons,
## 8135       spent the whole of every day in Conduit Street. For their own comfort
## 8136     they would much rather have remained, at least all the morning, in Mrs.
## 8137     Jennings&#39;s house; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes
## 8138    of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and
## 8139          the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact was as little
## 8140                                       valued, as it was professedly sought.
## 8141                                                                            
## 8142       They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and
## 8143      by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on
## 8144     THEIR ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize.
## 8145      Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton&#39;s behaviour to
## 8146     Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.  Because they
## 8147      neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not believe them
## 8148       good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she fancied them
## 8149     satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical;
## 8150         but THAT did not signify.  It was censure in common use, and easily
## 8151                                                                      given.
## 8152                                                                            
## 8153     Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy.  It checked the
## 8154         idleness of one, and the business of the other.  Lady Middleton was
## 8155       ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was
## 8156      proud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would
## 8157     despise her for offering.  Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the
## 8158     three, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her to
## 8159           it entirely.  Would either of them only have given her a full and
## 8160     minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby,
## 8161      she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the
## 8162        best place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned.
## 8163       But this conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw out
## 8164      expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt
## 8165     a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was
## 8166      produced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in
## 8167           the latter.  An effort even yet lighter might have made her their
## 8168      friend.  Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor!  But so
## 8169     little were they, anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her, that
## 8170            if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole day without
## 8171           hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what she was kind
## 8172                                                enough to bestow on herself.
## 8173                                                                            
## 8174              All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally
## 8175        unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing
## 8176         for the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her young
## 8177          friends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old
## 8178       woman so long.  She joined them sometimes at Sir John&#39;s, sometimes at
## 8179            her own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellent
## 8180       spirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte&#39;s well
## 8181       doing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail
## 8182       of her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.
## 8183        One thing DID disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint.
## 8184     Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his sex,
## 8185       of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly perceive, at
## 8186        different times, the most striking resemblance between this baby and
## 8187       every one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing his
## 8188     father of it; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like
## 8189           every other baby of the same age; nor could he even be brought to
## 8190     acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the
## 8191                                                                      world.
## 8192                                                                            
## 8193           I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time
## 8194       befell Mrs. John Dashwood.  It so happened that while her two sisters
## 8195      with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another
## 8196              of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance in itself not
## 8197       apparently likely to produce evil to her.  But while the imaginations
## 8198         of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our
## 8199         conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one&#39;s happiness
## 8200      must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.  In the present
## 8201         instance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun
## 8202          truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss
## 8203         Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood&#39;s sisters, she
## 8204         immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this
## 8205           misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of
## 8206     invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small
## 8207        musical party at her house.  The consequence of which was, that Mrs.
## 8208       John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great
## 8209     inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what
## 8210     was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing
## 8211        to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they might not
## 8212        expect to go out with her a second time?  The power of disappointing
## 8213       them, it was true, must always be hers.  But that was not enough; for
## 8214       when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be
## 8215        wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from
## 8216                                                                       them.
## 8217                                                                            
## 8218         Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of
## 8219         going out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to
## 8220     her, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and mechanically
## 8221       for every evening&#39;s engagement, though without expecting the smallest
## 8222           amusement from any, and very often without knowing, till the last
## 8223                                           moment, where it was to take her.
## 8224                                                                            
## 8225      To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, as
## 8226         not to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her
## 8227     toilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of
## 8228     their being together, when it was finished.  Nothing escaped HER minute
## 8229     observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and asked every
## 8230              thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of
## 8231     Marianne&#39;s dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether
## 8232       with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not without hopes
## 8233      of finding out before they parted, how much her washing cost per week,
## 8234                 and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.  The
## 8235           impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally
## 8236         concluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was
## 8237       considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after
## 8238          undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, the
## 8239        colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almost
## 8240     sure of being told that upon &quot;her word she looked vastly smart, and she
## 8241                        dared to say she would make a great many conquests.&quot;
## 8242                                                                            
## 8243           With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed on the present
## 8244         occasion, to her brother&#39;s carriage; which they were ready to enter
## 8245           five minutes after it stopped at the door, a punctuality not very
## 8246     agreeable to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house of
## 8247         her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay on their part
## 8248                    that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman.
## 8249                                                                            
## 8250       The events of this evening were not very remarkable.  The party, like
## 8251        other musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real
## 8252       taste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all;
## 8253      and the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,
## 8254        and that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in
## 8255                                                                    England.
## 8256                                                                            
## 8257          As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she made no
## 8258          scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it
## 8259            suited her, and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and
## 8260          violoncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the
## 8261     room.  In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of
## 8262     young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases
## 8263       at Gray&#39;s.  She perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself, and
## 8264     speaking familiarly to her brother; and had just determined to find out
## 8265          his name from the latter, when they both came towards her, and Mr.
## 8266                       Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.
## 8267                                                                            
## 8268        He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bow
## 8269          which assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he was
## 8270       exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy.  Happy
## 8271      had it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his
## 8272        own merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations!  For then his
## 8273              brother&#39;s bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the
## 8274        ill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun.  But while she
## 8275      wondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that
## 8276        the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out of all charity with
## 8277        the modesty and worth of the other.  Why they WERE different, Robert
## 8278            exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour&#39;s
## 8279        conversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme
## 8280           GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper
## 8281          society, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any
## 8282          natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education;
## 8283      while he himself, though probably without any particular, any material
## 8284        superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,
## 8285                    was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.
## 8286                                                                            
## 8287     &quot;Upon my soul,&quot; he added, &quot;I believe it is nothing more; and so I often
## 8288          tell my mother, when she is grieving about it.  &#39;My dear Madam,&#39; I
## 8289           always say to her, &#39;you must make yourself easy.  The evil is now
## 8290       irremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing.  Why would you
## 8291         be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to
## 8292        place Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his
## 8293           life?  If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself,
## 8294             instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt&#39;s, all this would have been
## 8295      prevented.&#39; This is the way in which I always consider the matter, and
## 8296                             my mother is perfectly convinced of her error.&quot;
## 8297                                                                            
## 8298         Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because, whatever might be her
## 8299       general estimation of the advantage of a public school, she could not
## 8300       think of Edward&#39;s abode in Mr. Pratt&#39;s family, with any satisfaction.
## 8301                                                                            
## 8302       &quot;You reside in Devonshire, I think,&quot;--was his next observation, &quot;in a
## 8303                                                      cottage near Dawlish.&quot;
## 8304                                                                            
## 8305              Elinor set him right as to its situation; and it seemed rather
## 8306     surprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire, without living
## 8307          near Dawlish.  He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their
## 8308                                                           species of house.
## 8309                                                                            
## 8310      &quot;For my own part,&quot; said he, &quot;I am excessively fond of a cottage; there
## 8311     is always so much comfort, so much elegance about them.  And I protest,
## 8312       if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one
## 8313       myself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself
## 8314      down at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy.  I
## 8315     advise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage.  My friend
## 8316        Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,
## 8317      and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi&#39;s.  I was to decide
## 8318     on the best of them.  &#39;My dear Courtland,&#39; said I, immediately throwing
## 8319      them all into the fire, &#39;do not adopt either of them, but by all means
## 8320                  build a cottage.&#39; And that I fancy, will be the end of it.
## 8321                                                                            
## 8322     &quot;Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in a
## 8323          cottage; but this is all a mistake.  I was last month at my friend
## 8324       Elliott&#39;s, near Dartford.  Lady Elliott wished to give a dance.  &#39;But
## 8325       how can it be done?&#39; said she; &#39;my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is
## 8326      to be managed.  There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten
## 8327          couple, and where can the supper be?&#39; I immediately saw that there
## 8328      could be no difficulty in it, so I said, &#39;My dear Lady Elliott, do not
## 8329        be uneasy.  The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;
## 8330      card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open
## 8331        for tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the
## 8332     saloon.&#39;  Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought.  We measured the
## 8333       dining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the
## 8334         affair was arranged precisely after my plan.  So that, in fact, you
## 8335     see, if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be as
## 8336                well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling.&quot;
## 8337                                                                            
## 8338              Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the
## 8339                                          compliment of rational opposition.
## 8340                                                                            
## 8341      As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister,
## 8342     his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else; and a thought
## 8343       struck him during the evening, which he communicated to his wife, for
## 8344             her approbation, when they got home.  The consideration of Mrs.
## 8345              Dennison&#39;s mistake, in supposing his sisters their guests, had
## 8346       suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such,
## 8347    while Mrs. Jennings&#39;s engagements kept her from home.  The expense would
## 8348            be nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether an
## 8349            attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be
## 8350           requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his
## 8351                                father.  Fanny was startled at the proposal.
## 8352                                                                            
## 8353       &quot;I do not see how it can be done,&quot; said she, &quot;without affronting Lady
## 8354         Middleton, for they spend every day with her; otherwise I should be
## 8355      exceedingly glad to do it.  You know I am always ready to pay them any
## 8356       attention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shews.  But
## 8357     they are Lady Middleton&#39;s visitors.  How can I ask them away from her?&quot;
## 8358                                                                            
## 8359          Her husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her
## 8360        objection.  &quot;They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit
## 8361      Street, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the
## 8362                                same number of days to such near relations.&quot;
## 8363                                                                            
## 8364                    Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,
## 8365                                                                            
## 8366         &quot;My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power.
## 8367     But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a
## 8368      few days with us.  They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and
## 8369       I think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very well
## 8370      by Edward.  We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but the
## 8371          Miss Steeles may not be in town any more.  I am sure you will like
## 8372         them; indeed, you DO like them, you know, very much already, and so
## 8373                   does my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!&quot;
## 8374                                                                            
## 8375      Mr. Dashwood was convinced.  He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss
## 8376      Steeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution
## 8377      of inviting his sisters another year; at the same time, however, slyly
## 8378         suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by
## 8379          bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon&#39;s wife, and Marianne as
## 8380                                                              THEIR visitor.
## 8381                                                                            
## 8382         Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready wit that had
## 8383     procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to request her company and
## 8384              her sister&#39;s, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as Lady
## 8385        Middleton could spare them.  This was enough to make Lucy really and
## 8386           reasonably happy.  Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her,
## 8387       herself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!  Such
## 8388           an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all
## 8389       things, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation the
## 8390     most gratifying to her feelings!  It was an advantage that could not be
## 8391          too gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the
## 8392       visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits,
## 8393      was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days&#39;
## 8394                                                                       time.
## 8395                                                                            
## 8396       When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after
## 8397             its arrival, it gave her, for the first time, some share in the
## 8398      expectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed
## 8399           on so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will
## 8400            towards her arose from something more than merely malice against
## 8401       herself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing
## 8402       that Lucy wished.  Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady
## 8403              Middleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John
## 8404          Dashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability of
## 8405                                                                    greater.

## 8407      The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor
## 8408        of their influence there, strengthened her expectation of the event.
## 8409     Sir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such accounts
## 8410          of the favour they were in, as must be universally striking.  Mrs.
## 8411         Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her
## 8412       life, as she was with them; had given each of them a needle book made
## 8413       by some emigrant; called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not know
## 8414                          whether she should ever be able to part with them.
## 8415

## 8428     Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her mother felt
## 8429        it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her; and,
## 8430     contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day, returned from
## 8431     that period to her own home, and her own habits, in which she found the
## 8432                     Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share.
## 8433                                                                            
## 8434       About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in
## 8435     Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her ordinary visit to
## 8436          Mrs. Palmer, entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting by
## 8437         herself, with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to
## 8438       hear something wonderful; and giving her time only to form that idea,
## 8439                                    began directly to justify it, by saying,
## 8440                                                                            
## 8441                     &quot;Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?&quot;
## 8442                                                                            
## 8443                                                   &quot;No, ma&#39;am.  What is it?&quot;
## 8444                                                                            
## 8445      &quot;Something so strange!  But you shall hear it all.-- When I got to Mr.
## 8446       Palmer&#39;s, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child.  She was
## 8447      sure it was very ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.
## 8448            So I looked at it directly, and, &#39;Lord! my dear,&#39; says I, &#39;it is
## 8449      nothing in the world, but the red gum--&#39; and nurse said just the same.
## 8450     But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for;
## 8451           and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he
## 8452                    stepped over directly, and as soon as ever Mama, he said
## 8453       just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and
## 8454       then Charlotte was easy.  And so, just as he was going away again, it
## 8455       came into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of
## 8456     it, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news.  So upon
## 8457        that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know
## 8458         something or other, and at last he said in a whisper, &#39;For fear any
## 8459       unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to
## 8460           their sister&#39;s indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I
## 8461       believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will
## 8462                                                             do very well.&#39;&quot;
## 8463                                                                            
## 8464                                                       &quot;What! is Fanny ill?&quot;
## 8465                                                                            
## 8466            &quot;That is exactly what I said, my dear.  &#39;Lord!&#39; says I, &#39;is Mrs.
## 8467       Dashwood ill?&#39; So then it all came out; and the long and the short of
## 8468      the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this.  Mr. Edward Ferrars,
## 8469        the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it
## 8470        turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr.
## 8471     Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my
## 8472       cousin Lucy!--There&#39;s for you, my dear!--And not a creature knowing a
## 8473       syllable of the matter, except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a
## 8474     thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another;
## 8475      but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody
## 8476       suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together,
## 8477        or I am sure I should have found it out directly.  Well, and so this
## 8478      was kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor
## 8479      your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--till this very
## 8480      morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no
## 8481        conjurer, popt it all out.  &#39;Lord!&#39; thinks she to herself, &#39;they are
## 8482     all so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;&#39;
## 8483      and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her
## 8484      carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come--for she had just been
## 8485       saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought to
## 8486     make a match between Edward and some Lord&#39;s daughter or other, I forget
## 8487      who.  So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride.
## 8488           She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as
## 8489     reached your brother&#39;s ears, as he was sitting in his own dressing-room
## 8490          down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the
## 8491      country.  So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for
## 8492      Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on.
## 8493          Poor soul!  I pity HER.  And I must say, I think she was used very
## 8494      hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her into
## 8495        a fainting fit.  Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly;
## 8496        and your brother, he walked about the room, and said he did not know
## 8497           what to do.  Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute
## 8498        longer in the house, and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS
## 8499         knees too, to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up
## 8500           their clothes.  THEN she fell into hysterics again, and he was so
## 8501        frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found
## 8502        the house in all this uproar.  The carriage was at the door ready to
## 8503        take my poor cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he came
## 8504     off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says, she could hardly walk; and
## 8505      Nancy, she was almost as bad.  I declare, I have no patience with your
## 8506       sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of
## 8507       her.  Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of
## 8508      it!  To have his love used so scornfully! for they say he is monstrous
## 8509       fond of her, as well he may.  I should not wonder, if he was to be in
## 8510      the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.  He and I
## 8511       had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he is
## 8512      gone back again to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs.
## 8513      Ferrars is told of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins
## 8514     left the house, for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too;
## 8515     and so she may, for what I care.  I have no pity for either of them.  I
## 8516              have no notion of people&#39;s making such a to-do about money and
## 8517      greatness.  There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should
## 8518     not marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her
## 8519     son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than
## 8520           any body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs.
## 8521         Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as
## 8522        good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight.  Lord!
## 8523      how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours--or a little
## 8524     bigger--with two maids, and two men; and I believe I could help them to
## 8525         a housemaid, for my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit
## 8526                                                              them exactly.&quot;
## 8527                                                                            
## 8528     Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to collect
## 8529            her thoughts, she was able to give such an answer, and make such
## 8530        observations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.
## 8531      Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest
## 8532      in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late often hoped might be the
## 8533        case) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward; and happy
## 8534     above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able
## 8535     to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her judgment,
## 8536              as she believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every one
## 8537                                                            concerned in it.
## 8538                                                                            
## 8539     She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really
## 8540       was; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being
## 8541       possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and
## 8542      Lucy.  What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could not be a
## 8543     doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear; and still more anxious to
## 8544               know how Edward would conduct himself.  For HIM she felt much
## 8545            compassion;--for Lucy very little--and it cost her some pains to
## 8546                procure that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.
## 8547                                                                            
## 8548        As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the
## 8549      necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion.  No time was to be
## 8550      lost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth,
## 8551            and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,
## 8552       without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister, or any
## 8553                                                  resentment against Edward.
## 8554                                                                            
## 8555        Elinor&#39;s office was a painful one.--She was going to remove what she
## 8556         really believed to be her sister&#39;s chief consolation,--to give such
## 8557     particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good
## 8558        opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,
## 8559       which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own disappointment
## 8560      over again.  But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was necessary to
## 8561                       be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.
## 8562                                                                            
## 8563           She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or to
## 8564              represent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the
## 8565        self-command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward&#39;s
## 8566       engagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.
## 8567        Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given
## 8568           without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor
## 8569          impetuous grief.--THAT belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne
## 8570          listened with horror, and cried excessively.  Elinor was to be the
## 8571      comforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; and
## 8572      all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure
## 8573     of mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but
## 8574                                         of imprudence, was readily offered.
## 8575                                                                            
## 8576     But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither.  Edward seemed
## 8577          a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she HAD
## 8578         loved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself!  As for
## 8579         Lucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely
## 8580      incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded
## 8581      at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of
## 8582      Edward for her.  She would not even admit it to have been natural; and
## 8583          Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which only
## 8584                          could convince her, a better knowledge of mankind.
## 8585                                                                            
## 8586       Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact
## 8587       of the engagement, and the length of time it had existed.--Marianne&#39;s
## 8588            feelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of
## 8589          detail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her
## 8590          distress, lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.  The first
## 8591              question on her side, which led to farther particulars, was,--
## 8592                                                                            
## 8593       &quot;How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he written to you?&quot;
## 8594                                                                            
## 8595         &quot;I have known it these four months.  When Lucy first came to Barton
## 8596           Park last November, she told me in confidence of her engagement.&quot;
## 8597                                                                            
## 8598        At these words, Marianne&#39;s eyes expressed the astonishment which her
## 8599             lips could not utter.  After a pause of wonder, she exclaimed--
## 8600                                                                            
## 8601                         &quot;Four months!--Have you known of this four months?&quot;
## 8602                                                                            
## 8603                                                        Elinor confirmed it.
## 8604                                                                            
## 8605          &quot;What!--while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your
## 8606                       heart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!&quot;--
## 8607                                                                            
## 8608      &quot;It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!&quot;
## 8609                                                                            
## 8610         &quot;Four months!&quot;--cried Marianne again.--&quot;So calm!--so cheerful!--how
## 8611                                                 have you been supported?&quot;--
## 8612                                                                            
## 8613       &quot;By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to Lucy, obliged me
## 8614     to be secret.  I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of
## 8615         the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in
## 8616            them a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to
## 8617                                                                   satisfy.&quot;
## 8618                                                                            
## 8619                                                Marianne seemed much struck.
## 8620                                                                            
## 8621       &quot;I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother,&quot; added
## 8622      Elinor; &quot;and once or twice I have attempted it;--but without betraying
## 8623                                my trust, I never could have convinced you.&quot;
## 8624                                                                            
## 8625                                    &quot;Four months!--and yet you loved him!&quot;--
## 8626                                                                            
## 8627     &quot;Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort of others was
## 8628          dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt.
## 8629     Now, I can think and speak of it with little emotion.  I would not have
## 8630               you suffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffer
## 8631             materially myself.  I have many things to support me.  I am not
## 8632     conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my
## 8633      own, I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther.
## 8634      I acquit Edward of essential misconduct.  I wish him very happy; and I
## 8635     am so sure of his always doing his duty, that though now he may harbour
## 8636       some regret, in the end he must become so.  Lucy does not want sense,
## 8637     and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.--And
## 8638          after all, Marianne, after all that is bewitching in the idea of a
## 8639           single and constant attachment, and all that can be said of one&#39;s
## 8640            happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is not
## 8641     meant--it is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.-- Edward
## 8642               will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person and
## 8643         understanding to half her sex; and time and habit will teach him to
## 8644                     forget that he ever thought another superior to HER.&quot;--
## 8645                                                                            
## 8646      &quot;If such is your way of thinking,&quot; said Marianne, &quot;if the loss of what
## 8647           is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your
## 8648            resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be
## 8649               wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension.&quot;
## 8650                                                                            
## 8651     &quot;I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--For
## 8652      four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without
## 8653       being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it
## 8654     would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to
## 8655           you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was told
## 8656      me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose
## 8657        prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought,
## 8658          with triumph.-- This person&#39;s suspicions, therefore, I have had to
## 8659        oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most
## 8660          deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her
## 8661           hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known
## 8662              myself to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one
## 8663        circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing
## 8664       has proved him unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to
## 8665       me.-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister, and
## 8666         the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the punishment of an
## 8667        attachment, without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has been
## 8668     going on at a time, when, as you know too well, it has not been my only
## 8669      unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you
## 8670     may suppose that I have suffered NOW.  The composure of mind with which
## 8671                I have brought myself at present to consider the matter, the
## 8672      consolation that I have been willing to admit, have been the effect of
## 8673                   constant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up of
## 8674       themselves;--they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No,
## 8675        Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothing
## 8676             could have kept me entirely--not even what I owed to my dearest
## 8677                    friends--from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy.&quot;--
## 8678                                                                            
## 8679                                               Marianne was quite subdued.--
## 8680                                                                            
## 8681       &quot;Oh! Elinor,&quot; she cried, &quot;you have made me hate myself for ever.--How
## 8682      barbarous have I been to you!--you, who have been my only comfort, who
## 8683             have borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only
## 8684     suffering for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I can
## 8685     make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying
## 8686                                                             to do it away.&quot;
## 8687                                                                            
## 8688        The tenderest caresses followed this confession.  In such a frame of
## 8689      mind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her
## 8690         whatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged
## 8691        never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of
## 8692        bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of
## 8693     dislike to her;--and even to see Edward himself, if chance should bring
## 8694      them together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality.-- These
## 8695      were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she had injured,
## 8696                            no reparation could be too much for her to make.
## 8697                                                                            
## 8698            She performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration.--She
## 8699     attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an
## 8700         unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard
## 8701       three times to say, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot;--She listened to her praise of Lucy
## 8702          with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings
## 8703               talked of Edward&#39;s affection, it cost her only a spasm in her
## 8704      throat.--Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel
## 8705                                                 equal to any thing herself.
## 8706                                                                            
## 8707       The next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their
## 8708      brother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful
## 8709                                    affair, and bring them news of his wife.
## 8710                                                                            
## 8711       &quot;You have heard, I suppose,&quot; said he with great solemnity, as soon as
## 8712        he was seated, &quot;of the very shocking discovery that took place under
## 8713                                                        our roof yesterday.&quot;
## 8714                                                                            
## 8715      They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech.
## 8716                                                                            
## 8717        &quot;Your sister,&quot; he continued, &quot;has suffered dreadfully.  Mrs. Ferrars
## 8718       too--in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress--but I
## 8719       will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us
## 8720     quite overcome.  Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday.  But I
## 8721     would not alarm you too much.  Donavan says there is nothing materially
## 8722       to be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her resolution
## 8723         equal to any thing.  She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an
## 8724       angel!  She says she never shall think well of anybody again; and one
## 8725            cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--meeting with such
## 8726      ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shewn, so much confidence
## 8727         had been placed!  It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart,
## 8728       that she had asked these young women to her house; merely because she
## 8729           thought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behaved
## 8730       girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wished
## 8731        very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while your
## 8732            kind friend there, was attending her daughter.  And now to be so
## 8733              rewarded!  &#39;I wish, with all my heart,&#39; says poor Fanny in her
## 8734        affectionate way, &#39;that we had asked your sisters instead of them.&#39;&quot;
## 8735                                                                            
## 8736                Here he stopped to be thanked; which being done, he went on.
## 8737                                                                            
## 8738      &quot;What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, is
## 8739          not to be described.  While she with the truest affection had been
## 8740     planning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed that
## 8741        he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such a
## 8742          suspicion could never have entered her head!  If she suspected ANY
## 8743       prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in THAT quarter.  &#39;THERE, to
## 8744       be sure,&#39; said she, &#39;I might have thought myself safe.&#39; She was quite
## 8745          in an agony.  We consulted together, however, as to what should be
## 8746       done, and at last she determined to send for Edward.  He came.  But I
## 8747         am sorry to relate what ensued.  All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to
## 8748         make him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well
## 8749           suppose by my arguments, and Fanny&#39;s entreaties, was of no avail.
## 8750       Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.  I never thought Edward
## 8751          so stubborn, so unfeeling before.  His mother explained to him her
## 8752          liberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she
## 8753           would settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax,
## 8754           brings in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters grew
## 8755      desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he
## 8756      still persisted in this low connection, represented to him the certain
## 8757         penury that must attend the match.  His own two thousand pounds she
## 8758      protested should be his all; she would never see him again; and so far
## 8759         would she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if he
## 8760        were to enter into any profession with a view of better support, she
## 8761                  would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it.&quot;
## 8762                                                                            
## 8763              Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her hands
## 8764                 together, and cried, &quot;Gracious God!  can this be possible!&quot;
## 8765                                                                            
## 8766     &quot;Well may you wonder, Marianne,&quot; replied her brother, &quot;at the obstinacy
## 8767       which could resist such arguments as these.  Your exclamation is very
## 8768                                                                   natural.&quot;
## 8769                                                                            
## 8770          Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered her promises, and
## 8771                                                                    forbore.
## 8772                                                                            
## 8773         &quot;All this, however,&quot; he continued, &quot;was urged in vain.  Edward said
## 8774        very little; but what he did say, was in the most determined manner.
## 8775          Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement.  He would
## 8776                                       stand to it, cost him what it might.&quot;
## 8777                                                                            
## 8778      &quot;Then,&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, no longer able to be
## 8779            silent, &quot;he has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr.
## 8780         Dashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I should have thought him a
## 8781             rascal.  I have some little concern in the business, as well as
## 8782        yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a
## 8783          better kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good
## 8784                                                                   husband.&quot;
## 8785                                                                            
## 8786     John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature was calm, not open
## 8787           to provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especially
## 8788     anybody of good fortune.  He therefore replied, without any resentment,
## 8789                                                                            
## 8790        &quot;I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours,
## 8791      madam.  Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman,
## 8792        but in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible.
## 8793     And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her
## 8794      uncle&#39;s care, the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune
## 8795          as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In
## 8796       short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom
## 8797     you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  We all wish her extremely happy;
## 8798     and Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s conduct throughout the whole, has been such as every
## 8799     conscientious, good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt.  It has
## 8800       been dignified and liberal.  Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear
## 8801                                                      it will be a bad one.&quot;
## 8802                                                                            
## 8803      Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension; and Elinor&#39;s heart wrung
## 8804       for the feelings of Edward, while braving his mother&#39;s threats, for a
## 8805                                             woman who could not reward him.
## 8806                                                                            
## 8807                      &quot;Well, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, &quot;and how did it end?&quot;
## 8808                                                                            
## 8809           &quot;I am sorry to say, ma&#39;am, in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward is
## 8810             dismissed for ever from his mother&#39;s notice.  He left her house
## 8811       yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do
## 8812                            not know; for WE of course can make no inquiry.&quot;
## 8813                                                                            
## 8814                            &quot;Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?&quot;
## 8815                                                                            
## 8816       &quot;What, indeed, ma&#39;am!  It is a melancholy consideration.  Born to the
## 8817             prospect of such affluence!  I cannot conceive a situation more
## 8818     deplorable.  The interest of two thousand pounds--how can a man live on
## 8819     it?--and when to that is added the recollection, that he might, but for
## 8820          his own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of two
## 8821          thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has thirty thousand
## 8822     pounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition.  We must
## 8823         all feel for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of our
## 8824                                                       power to assist him.&quot;
## 8825                                                                            
## 8826         &quot;Poor young man!&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings, &quot;I am sure he should be very
## 8827          welcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him if I
## 8828     could see him.  It is not fit that he should be living about at his own
## 8829                                       charge now, at lodgings and taverns.&quot;
## 8830                                                                            
## 8831     Elinor&#39;s heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward, though she
## 8832                                could not forbear smiling at the form of it.
## 8833                                                                            
## 8834        &quot;If he would only have done as well by himself,&quot; said John Dashwood,
## 8835      &quot;as all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have been
## 8836      in his proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing.  But as it
## 8837      is, it must be out of anybody&#39;s power to assist him.  And there is one
## 8838         thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than all--his
## 8839        mother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle
## 8840     THAT estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward&#39;s, on
## 8841        proper conditions.  I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking
## 8842                                                         over the business.&quot;
## 8843                                                                            
## 8844      &quot;Well!&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, &quot;that is HER revenge.  Everybody has a way
## 8845             of their own.  But I don&#39;t think mine would be, to make one son
## 8846                               independent, because another had plagued me.&quot;
## 8847                                                                            
## 8848                                  Marianne got up and walked about the room.
## 8849                                                                            
## 8850      &quot;Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,&quot; continued John,
## 8851     &quot;than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might
## 8852                have been his own?  Poor Edward!  I feel for him sincerely.&quot;
## 8853                                                                            
## 8854        A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded his
## 8855           visit; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really
## 8856         believed there was no material danger in Fanny&#39;s indisposition, and
## 8857         that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;
## 8858       leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present
## 8859        occasion, as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s conduct, the
## 8860                                                   Dashwoods&#39;, and Edward&#39;s.
## 8861                                                                            
## 8862      Marianne&#39;s indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room; and
## 8863      as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in
## 8864         Mrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the
## 8865                                                                      party.
## 8866                                                                            
## 8867                                                                            
## 8868                                                                            
## 8869                                                                  CHAPTER 38
## 8870                                                                            
## 8871                                                                            
## 8872     Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward&#39;s conduct, but only
## 8873          Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit.  THEY only knew how
## 8874     little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small was the
## 8875     consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could remain
## 8876           to him in the loss of friends and fortune.  Elinor gloried in his
## 8877      integrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his
## 8878         punishment.  But though confidence between them was, by this public
## 8879      discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on which
## 8880         either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.  Elinor avoided it
## 8881      upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the
## 8882      too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward&#39;s
## 8883     continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away; and
## 8884      Marianne&#39;s courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topic
## 8885      which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the
## 8886    comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor&#39;s conduct and her own.
## 8887                                                                            
## 8888        She felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her sister had
## 8889        hoped, to urge her to exertion now; she felt it with all the pain of
## 8890         continual self-reproach, regretted most bitterly that she had never
## 8891       exerted herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,
## 8892      without the hope of amendment.  Her mind was so much weakened that she
## 8893            still fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it only
## 8894                                                        dispirited her more.
## 8895                                                                            
## 8896      Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairs
## 8897       in Harley Street, or Bartlett&#39;s Buildings.  But though so much of the
## 8898         matter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had
## 8899     enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking after
## 8900         more, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and
## 8901            inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but the
## 8902      hindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to them
## 8903                                                           within that time.
## 8904                                                                            
## 8905         The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so
## 8906          fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens,
## 8907      though it was only the second week in March.  Mrs. Jennings and Elinor
## 8908        were of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were
## 8909       again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather
## 8910                       to stay at home, than venture into so public a place.
## 8911                                                                            
## 8912       An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they
## 8913        entered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing
## 8914           with them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings&#39;s conversation, she was
## 8915      herself left to quiet reflection.  She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,
## 8916        nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by
## 8917        any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her.  But at last
## 8918         she found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who,
## 8919          though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting
## 8920        them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of
## 8921        Mrs. Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their&#39;s.
## 8922                              Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,
## 8923                                                                            
## 8924        &quot;Get it all out of her, my dear.  She will tell you any thing if you
## 8925                                  ask.  You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.&quot;
## 8926                                                                            
## 8927      It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings&#39;s curiosity and Elinor&#39;s too,
## 8928        that she would tell any thing WITHOUT being asked; for nothing would
## 8929                                                 otherwise have been learnt.
## 8930                                                                            
## 8931      &quot;I am so glad to meet you;&quot; said Miss Steele, taking her familiarly by
## 8932         the arm--&quot;for I wanted to see you of all things in the world.&quot;  And
## 8933       then lowering her voice, &quot;I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about
## 8934                                                         it.  Is she angry?&quot;
## 8935                                                                            
## 8936                                          &quot;Not at all, I believe, with you.&quot;
## 8937                                                                            
## 8938                  &quot;That is a good thing.  And Lady Middleton, is SHE angry?&quot;
## 8939                                                                            
## 8940                          &quot;I cannot suppose it possible that she should be.&quot;
## 8941                                                                            
## 8942      &quot;I am monstrous glad of it.  Good gracious!  I have had such a time of
## 8943        it!  I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life.  She vowed at first
## 8944       she would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me
## 8945       again, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we are
## 8946     as good friends as ever.  Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and put
## 8947         in the feather last night.  There now, YOU are going to laugh at me
## 8948       too.  But why should not I wear pink ribbons?  I do not care if it IS
## 8949      the Doctor&#39;s favourite colour.  I am sure, for my part, I should never
## 8950       have known he DID like it better than any other colour, if he had not
## 8951        happened to say so.  My cousins have been so plaguing me!  I declare
## 8952                     sometimes I do not know which way to look before them.&quot;
## 8953                                                                            
## 8954      She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say,
## 8955        and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to
## 8956                                                                  the first.
## 8957                                                                            
## 8958      &quot;Well, but Miss Dashwood,&quot; speaking triumphantly, &quot;people may say what
## 8959     they chuse about Mr. Ferrars&#39;s declaring he would not have Lucy, for it
## 8960           is no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such
## 8961         ill-natured reports to be spread abroad.  Whatever Lucy might think
## 8962       about it herself, you know, it was no business of other people to set
## 8963                                                       it down for certain.&quot;
## 8964                                                                            
## 8965       &quot;I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you,&quot;
## 8966                                                                said Elinor.
## 8967                                                                            
## 8968     &quot;Oh, did not you?  But it WAS said, I know, very well, and by more than
## 8969     one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses could
## 8970         expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty
## 8971         thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing at
## 8972     all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself.  And besides that, my cousin
## 8973      Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr.
## 8974        Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us for three
## 8975      days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in my heart
## 8976          Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your brother&#39;s
## 8977          Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, and
## 8978       Saturday, and did not know what was become of him.  Once Lucy thought
## 8979      to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that.  However this
## 8980      morning he came just as we came home from church; and then it all came
## 8981          out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and been
## 8982     talked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had declared before
## 8983        them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he
## 8984       have.  And how he had been so worried by what passed, that as soon as
## 8985        he had went away from his mother&#39;s house, he had got upon his horse,
## 8986        and rid into the country, some where or other; and how he had stayed
## 8987       about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better
## 8988          of it.  And after thinking it all over and over again, he said, it
## 8989       seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at all, it
## 8990     would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because it must
## 8991         be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no
## 8992     hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he had some
## 8993       thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they to live
## 8994       upon that?--He could not bear to think of her doing no better, and so
## 8995           he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the
## 8996      matter directly, and leave him shift for himself.  I heard him say all
## 8997      this as plain as could possibly be.  And it was entirely for HER sake,
## 8998     and upon HER account, that he said a word about being off, and not upon
## 8999      his own.  I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired
## 9000     of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing like it.  But,
## 9001         to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so she
## 9002        told him directly (with a great deal about sweet and love, you know,
## 9003              and all that--Oh, la! one can&#39;t repeat such kind of things you
## 9004       know)--she told him directly, she had not the least mind in the world
## 9005     to be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how little so
## 9006       ever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all, you know,
## 9007       or something of the kind.  So then he was monstrous happy, and talked
## 9008      on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he should take
## 9009     orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he got a living.
## 9010          And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin called from
## 9011      below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and would take
## 9012        one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into the room
## 9013        and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did
## 9014      not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of
## 9015                          silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.&quot;
## 9016                                                                            
## 9017      &quot;I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,&quot; said Elinor;
## 9018                     &quot;you were all in the same room together, were not you?&quot;
## 9019                                                                            
## 9020      &quot;No, indeed, not us.  La! Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love
## 9021         when any body else is by?  Oh, for shame!--To be sure you must know
## 9022     better than that.  (Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in
## 9023     the drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at the
## 9024                                                                      door.&quot;
## 9025                                                                            
## 9026           &quot;How!&quot; cried Elinor; &quot;have you been repeating to me what you only
## 9027     learnt yourself by listening at the door?  I am sorry I did not know it
## 9028              before; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me
## 9029             particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known
## 9030                yourself.  How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?&quot;
## 9031                                                                            
## 9032     &quot;Oh, la! there is nothing in THAT.  I only stood at the door, and heard
## 9033      what I could.  And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me;
## 9034        for a year or two back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets
## 9035       together, she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind a
## 9036                            chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.&quot;
## 9037                                                                            
## 9038        Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss Steele could not be
## 9039       kept beyond a couple of minutes, from what was uppermost in her mind.
## 9040                                                                            
## 9041            &quot;Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,&quot; said she; &quot;but now he is
## 9042     lodging at No. --, Pall Mall.  What an ill-natured woman his mother is,
## 9043        an&#39;t she? And your brother and sister were not very kind! However, I
## 9044       shan&#39;t say anything against them to YOU; and to be sure they did send
## 9045        us home in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for.  And
## 9046       for my part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us
## 9047         for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,
## 9048     nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of sight.
## 9049       Edward have got some business at Oxford, he says; so he must go there
## 9050       for a time; and after THAT, as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he
## 9051        will be ordained.  I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious!
## 9052         (giggling as she spoke) I&#39;d lay my life I know what my cousins will
## 9053         say, when they hear of it.  They will tell me I should write to the
## 9054      Doctor, to get Edward the curacy of his new living.  I know they will;
## 9055      but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.-- &#39;La!&#39; I
## 9056       shall say directly, &#39;I wonder how you could think of such a thing?  I
## 9057                                              write to the Doctor, indeed!&#39;&quot;
## 9058                                                                            
## 9059     &quot;Well,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst.
## 9060                                            You have got your answer ready.&quot;
## 9061                                                                            
## 9062     Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach of
## 9063                                  her own party made another more necessary.
## 9064                                                                            
## 9065       &quot;Oh, la! here come the Richardsons.  I had a vast deal more to say to
## 9066       you, but I must not stay away from them not any longer.  I assure you
## 9067      they are very genteel people.  He makes a monstrous deal of money, and
## 9068       they keep their own coach.  I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings
## 9069      about it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not
## 9070           in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same; and if anything
## 9071           should happen to take you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jennings
## 9072      should want company, I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay
## 9073         with her for as long a time as she likes.  I suppose Lady Middleton
## 9074     won&#39;t ask us any more this bout.  Good-by; I am sorry Miss Marianne was
## 9075         not here.  Remember me kindly to her.  La! if you have not got your
## 9076         spotted muslin on!--I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn.&quot;
## 9077                                                                            
## 9078      Such was her parting concern; for after this, she had time only to pay
## 9079           her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, before her company was
## 9080            claimed by Mrs. Richardson; and Elinor was left in possession of
## 9081       knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time, though
## 9082     she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and
## 9083     foreplanned in her own mind.  Edward&#39;s marriage with Lucy was as firmly
## 9084      determined on, and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely
## 9085         uncertain, as she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended,
## 9086           exactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment, of
## 9087                    which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.
## 9088                                                                            
## 9089       As soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager for
## 9090           information; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible
## 9091     intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained, she
## 9092     confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars, as
## 9093      she felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her own consequence, would
## 9094         choose to have known.  The continuance of their engagement, and the
## 9095         means that were able to be taken for promoting its end, was all her
## 9096           communication; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following
## 9097                                                             natural remark.
## 9098                                                                            
## 9099               &quot;Wait for his having a living!--ay, we all know how THAT will
## 9100        end:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it,
## 9101       will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year, with the interest
## 9102       of his two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr.
## 9103       Pratt can give her.--Then they will have a child every year! and Lord
## 9104           help &#39;em! how poor they will be!--I must see what I can give them
## 9105       towards furnishing their house.  Two maids and two men, indeed!--as I
## 9106           talked of t&#39;other day.--No, no, they must get a stout girl of all
## 9107                       works.-- Betty&#39;s sister would never do for them NOW.&quot;
## 9108                                                                            
## 9109         The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from
## 9110                                           Lucy herself.  It was as follows:
## 9111                                                                            
## 9112                                                &quot;Bartlett&#39;s Building, March.
## 9113                                                                            
## 9114                               &quot;I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the
## 9115                           liberty I take of writing to her; but I know your
## 9116                        friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such
## 9117                          a good account of myself and my dear Edward, after
## 9118                               all the troubles we have went through lately,
## 9119                          therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed
## 9120                             to say that, thank God! though we have suffered
## 9121                        dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy
## 9122                        as we must always be in one another&#39;s love.  We have
## 9123                               had great trials, and great persecutions, but
## 9124                           however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge
## 9125                            many friends, yourself not the least among them,
## 9126                              whose great kindness I shall always thankfully
## 9127                            remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of
## 9128                        it.  I am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise
## 9129                            dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours with
## 9130                           him yesterday afternoon, he would not hear of our
## 9131                            parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought my
## 9132                            duty required, urge him to it for prudence sake,
## 9133                           and would have parted for ever on the spot, would
## 9134                           he consent to it; but he said it should never be,
## 9135                        he did not regard his mother&#39;s anger, while he could
## 9136                              have my affections; our prospects are not very
## 9137                          bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope for
## 9138                           the best; he will be ordained shortly; and should
## 9139                            it ever be in your power to recommend him to any
## 9140                          body that has a living to bestow, am very sure you
## 9141                             will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too,
## 9142                        trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John,
## 9143                            or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to
## 9144                            assist us.--Poor Anne was much to blame for what
## 9145                              she did, but she did it for the best, so I say
## 9146                         nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won&#39;t think it too much
## 9147                         trouble to give us a call, should she come this way
## 9148                            any morning, &#39;twould be a great kindness, and my
## 9149                       cousins would be proud to know her.--My paper reminds
## 9150                           me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully
## 9151                        and respectfully remembered to her, and to Sir John,
## 9152                         and Lady Middleton, and the dear children, when you
## 9153                              chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne,
## 9154                                                                            
## 9155                                                                 &quot;I am, &amp;c.&quot;
## 9156                                                                            
## 9157      As soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded to
## 9158             be its writer&#39;s real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs.
## 9159          Jennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and
## 9160                                                                     praise.

## 9162           &quot;Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye, that was quite
## 9163       proper to let him be off if he would.  That was just like Lucy.--Poor

## 9165            dear Mrs. Jennings, you see.  She is a good-hearted girl as ever
## 9166     lived.--Very well upon my word.  That sentence is very prettily turned.
## 9167     Yes, yes, I will go and see her, sure enough.  How attentive she is, to
## 9168      think of every body!--Thank you, my dear, for shewing it me.  It is as
## 9169         pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy&#39;s head and heart great
## 9170                                                                    credit.&quot;

## 9177        The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town,
## 9178       and Marianne&#39;s impatience to be gone increased every day.  She sighed
## 9179     for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if
## 9180        any place could give her ease, Barton must do it.  Elinor was hardly
## 9181     less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent
## 9182         on its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of the
## 9183      difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought
## 9184         to acknowledge.  She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts
## 9185       towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to
## 9186         their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her
## 9187     good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from
## 9188        home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more
## 9189      eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about
## 9190     the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both
## 9191      her friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with
## 9192     them.  This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy
## 9193      of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by
## 9194           Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of his
## 9195         manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy,
## 9196                                     induced her to accept it with pleasure.
## 9197                                                                            
## 9198      When she told Marianne what she had done, however, her first reply was
## 9199                                                        not very auspicious.
## 9200                                                                            
## 9201         &quot;Cleveland!&quot;--she cried, with great agitation.  &quot;No, I cannot go to
## 9202                                                               Cleveland.&quot;--
## 9203                                                                            
## 9204      &quot;You forget,&quot; said Elinor gently, &quot;that its situation is not...that it
## 9205                                          is not in the neighbourhood of...&quot;
## 9206                                                                            
## 9207       &quot;But it is in Somersetshire.--I cannot go into Somersetshire.--There,
## 9208       where I looked forward to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to
## 9209                                                                  go there.&quot;
## 9210                                                                            
## 9211                Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such
## 9212            feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on
## 9213        others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix the
## 9214       time of her returning to that dear mother, whom she so much wished to
## 9215       see, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plan
## 9216     could do, and perhaps without any greater delay.  From Cleveland, which
## 9217           was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not
## 9218     beyond one day, though a long day&#39;s journey; and their mother&#39;s servant
## 9219       might easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be no
## 9220      occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be
## 9221     at home in little more than three weeks&#39; time.  As Marianne&#39;s affection
## 9222         for her mother was sincere, it must triumph with little difficulty,
## 9223                                   over the imaginary evils she had started.
## 9224                                                                            
## 9225           Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guests, that she
## 9226        pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland.
## 9227           Elinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her
## 9228          design; and their mother&#39;s concurrence being readily gained, every
## 9229     thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;--and
## 9230      Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that
## 9231                                         were yet to divide her from Barton.
## 9232                                                                            
## 9233        &quot;Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss
## 9234     Dashwoods;&quot;--was Mrs. Jennings&#39;s address to him when he first called on
## 9235      her, after their leaving her was settled--&quot;for they are quite resolved
## 9236      upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall be, when I
## 9237       come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two
## 9238                                                                      cats.&quot;
## 9239                                                                            
## 9240        Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their
## 9241           future ennui, to provoke him to make that offer, which might give
## 9242         himself an escape from it;--and if so, she had soon afterwards good
## 9243           reason to think her object gained; for, on Elinor&#39;s moving to the
## 9244      window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she
## 9245      was going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it with a look of
## 9246       particular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes.
## 9247           The effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her
## 9248       observation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even
## 9249       changed her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear, to one close by
## 9250           the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep
## 9251               herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with
## 9252                 agitation, and was too intent on what he said to pursue her
## 9253            employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the
## 9254       interval of Marianne&#39;s turning from one lesson to another, some words
## 9255       of the Colonel&#39;s inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to be
## 9256     apologising for the badness of his house.  This set the matter beyond a
## 9257        doubt.  She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so;
## 9258      but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.  What Elinor said in reply
## 9259     she could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, that
## 9260           she did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings
## 9261        commended her in her heart for being so honest.  They then talked on
## 9262      for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable, when another
## 9263         lucky stop in Marianne&#39;s performance brought her these words in the
## 9264                                                     Colonel&#39;s calm voice,--
## 9265                                                                            
## 9266                               &quot;I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.&quot;
## 9267                                                                            
## 9268          Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost
## 9269          ready to cry out, &quot;Lord! what should hinder it?&quot;--but checking her
## 9270                        desire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation.
## 9271                                                                            
## 9272                 &quot;This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older.&quot;
## 9273                                                                            
## 9274        This delay on the Colonel&#39;s side, however, did not seem to offend or
## 9275       mortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the
## 9276        conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings
## 9277         very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to
## 9278                                                         feel what she said,
## 9279                                                                            
## 9280                     &quot;I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.&quot;
## 9281                                                                            
## 9282      Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered that
## 9283     after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take leave
## 9284     of them, as he immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away
## 9285     without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend could
## 9286                                          have made so indifferent a suitor.
## 9287                                                                            
## 9288                     What had really passed between them was to this effect.
## 9289                                                                            
## 9290      &quot;I have heard,&quot; said he, with great compassion, &quot;of the injustice your
## 9291        friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand
## 9292     the matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering
## 9293          in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been
## 9294                                             rightly informed?--Is it so?--&quot;
## 9295                                                                            
## 9296                                                Elinor told him that it was.
## 9297                                                                            
## 9298               &quot;The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,&quot;--he replied, with great
## 9299      feeling,--&quot;of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long
## 9300      attached to each other, is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what
## 9301           she may be doing--what she may drive her son to.  I have seen Mr.
## 9302       Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with
## 9303      him.  He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted
## 9304     in a short time, but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his
## 9305     own sake, and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.  I understand
## 9306         that he intends to take orders.  Will you be so good as to tell him
## 9307      that the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by this
## 9308          day&#39;s post, is his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but THAT,
## 9309             perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may be
## 9310       nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were more  valuable.-- It
## 9311       is a rectory, but a small one; the late incumbent, I believe, did not
## 9312       make more than 200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable of
## 9313          improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as to afford him a very
## 9314      comfortable income.  Such as it is, however, my pleasure in presenting
## 9315                     it to him, will be very great.  Pray assure him of it.&quot;
## 9316                                                                            
## 9317             Elinor&#39;s astonishment at this commission could hardly have been
## 9318       greater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand.
## 9319            The preferment, which only two days before she had considered as
## 9320      hopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--and
## 9321            SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!--Her
## 9322        emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different
## 9323         cause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might
## 9324       have a share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,
## 9325             and her gratitude for the particular friendship, which together
## 9326        prompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly
## 9327             expressed.  She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of
## 9328         Edward&#39;s principles and disposition with that praise which she knew
## 9329              them to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with
## 9330      pleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office
## 9331      to another.  But at the same time, she could not help thinking that no
## 9332        one could so well perform it as himself.  It was an office in short,
## 9333               from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an
## 9334             obligation from HER, she would have been very glad to be spared
## 9335     herself;-- but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, declining
## 9336        it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through her
## 9337           means, that she would not on any account make farther opposition.
## 9338      Edward, she believed, was still in town, and fortunately she had heard
## 9339      his address from Miss Steele.  She could undertake therefore to inform
## 9340          him of it, in the course of the day.  After this had been settled,
## 9341           Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so
## 9342              respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and THEN it was that he
## 9343        mentioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferent;--an
## 9344       evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very
## 9345                             light of, at least as far as regarded its size.
## 9346                                                                            
## 9347               &quot;The smallness of the house,&quot; said she, &quot;I cannot imagine any
## 9348     inconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family and
## 9349                                                                    income.&quot;
## 9350                                                                            
## 9351     By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr.
## 9352      Ferrars&#39;s marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation; for
## 9353       he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such
## 9354          an income, as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle
## 9355                                                         on--and he said so.
## 9356                                                                            
## 9357       &quot;This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable
## 9358       as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry.  I am sorry to say that
## 9359      my patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly more extensive.
## 9360      If, however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve
## 9361       him farther, I must think very differently of him from what I now do,
## 9362         if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I
## 9363     could be at present.  What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all,
## 9364      since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal,
## 9365         his only object of happiness.  His marriage must still be a distant
## 9366             good;--at least, I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.--&quot;
## 9367                                                                            
## 9368     Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended the
## 9369        delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of what
## 9370       really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at
## 9371     the window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may
## 9372            perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited, nor less
## 9373            properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage.
## 9374                                                                            
## 9375                                                                            
## 9376                                                                            
## 9377                                                                  CHAPTER 40
## 9378                                                                            
## 9379                                                                            
## 9380     &quot;Well, Miss Dashwood,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as soon
## 9381      as the gentleman had withdrawn, &quot;I do not ask you what the Colonel has
## 9382      been saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I TRIED to keep out of
## 9383       hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand his business.
## 9384      And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life, and I wish you
## 9385                                               joy of it with all my heart.&quot;
## 9386                                                                            
## 9387       &quot;Thank you, ma&#39;am,&quot; said Elinor.  &quot;It is a matter of great joy to me;
## 9388        and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly.  There are
## 9389          not many men who would act as he has done.  Few people who have so
## 9390            compassionate a heart!  I never was more astonished in my life.&quot;
## 9391                                                                            
## 9392     &quot;Lord! my dear, you are very modest.  I an&#39;t the least astonished at it
## 9393      in the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more
## 9394                                                          likely to happen.&quot;
## 9395                                                                            
## 9396       &quot;You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel&#39;s general benevolence;
## 9397       but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very
## 9398                                                                soon occur.&quot;
## 9399                                                                            
## 9400      &quot;Opportunity!&quot; repeated Mrs. Jennings--&quot;Oh! as to that, when a man has
## 9401        once made up his mind to such a thing, somehow or other he will soon
## 9402         find an opportunity.  Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and
## 9403         again; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think I
## 9404                                    shall soon know where to look for them.&quot;
## 9405                                                                            
## 9406      &quot;You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,&quot; said Elinor, with a
## 9407                                                                faint smile.
## 9408                                                                            
## 9409     &quot;Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed.  And as to the house being a bad one,
## 9410      I do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as
## 9411                                                                ever I saw.&quot;
## 9412                                                                            
## 9413                                      &quot;He spoke of its being out of repair.&quot;
## 9414                                                                            
## 9415      &quot;Well, and whose fault is that? why don&#39;t he repair it?--who should do
## 9416                                                            it but himself?&quot;
## 9417                                                                            
## 9418            They were interrupted by the servant&#39;s coming in to announce the
## 9419      carriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to
## 9420                                                                 go, said,--
## 9421                                                                            
## 9422          &quot;Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half my talk out.
## 9423       But, however, we may have it all over in the evening; for we shall be
## 9424      quite alone.  I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind
## 9425        is too full of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must
## 9426                                     long to tell your sister all about it.&quot;
## 9427                                                                            
## 9428                   Marianne had left the room before the conversation began.
## 9429                                                                            
## 9430     &quot;Certainly, ma&#39;am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not mention
## 9431                                            it at present to any body else.&quot;
## 9432                                                                            
## 9433         &quot;Oh! very well,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed.  &quot;Then you
## 9434           would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far as
## 9435                                                            Holborn to-day.&quot;
## 9436                                                                            
## 9437       &quot;No, ma&#39;am, not even Lucy if you please.  One day&#39;s delay will not be
## 9438     very material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought
## 9439     not to be mentioned to any body else.  I shall do THAT directly.  It is
## 9440          of importance that no time should be lost with him, for he will of
## 9441                         course have much to do relative to his ordination.&quot;
## 9442                                                                            
## 9443            This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly.  Why Mr.
## 9444     Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she could
## 9445            not immediately comprehend.  A few moments&#39; reflection, however,
## 9446                            produced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed;--
## 9447                                                                            
## 9448        &quot;Oh, ho!--I understand you.  Mr. Ferrars is to be the man.  Well, so
## 9449            much the better for him.  Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in
## 9450         readiness; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between
## 9451        you.  But, my dear, is not this rather out of character?  Should not
## 9452                 the Colonel write himself?--sure, he is the proper person.&quot;
## 9453                                                                            
## 9454            Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings&#39;s
## 9455        speech, neither did she think it worth inquiring into; and therefore
## 9456                                             only replied to its conclusion.
## 9457                                                                            
## 9458     &quot;Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one to
## 9459                       announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself.&quot;
## 9460                                                                            
## 9461     &quot;And so YOU are forced to do it.  Well THAT is an odd kind of delicacy!
## 9462       However, I will not disturb you (seeing her preparing to write.)  You
## 9463      know your own concerns best.  So goodby, my dear.  I have not heard of
## 9464         any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed.&quot;
## 9465                                                                            
## 9466                         And away she went; but returning again in a moment,
## 9467                                                                            
## 9468         &quot;I have just been thinking of Betty&#39;s sister, my dear.  I should be
## 9469      very glad to get her so good a mistress.  But whether she would do for
## 9470      a lady&#39;s maid, I am sure I can&#39;t tell.  She is an excellent housemaid,
## 9471     and works very well at her needle.  However, you will think of all that
## 9472                                                           at your leisure.&quot;
## 9473                                                                            
## 9474      &quot;Certainly, ma&#39;am,&quot; replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said,
## 9475           and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.
## 9476                                                                            
## 9477         How she should begin--how she should express herself in her note to
## 9478      Edward, was now all her concern.  The particular circumstances between
## 9479         them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have
## 9480      been the easiest thing in the world; but she equally feared to say too
## 9481       much or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the pen
## 9482           in her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.
## 9483                                                                            
## 9484      He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as he
## 9485         came to leave his farewell card; and she, after apologising for not
## 9486            returning herself, had obliged him to enter, by saying that Miss
## 9487         Dashwood was above, and wanted to speak with him on very particular
## 9488                                                                   business.
## 9489                                                                            
## 9490            Elinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her
## 9491           perplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself
## 9492                properly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the
## 9493        information by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her
## 9494         upon this greatest exertion of all.  Her astonishment and confusion
## 9495          were very great on his so sudden appearance.  She had not seen him
## 9496      before since his engagement became public, and therefore not since his
## 9497      knowing her to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness of
## 9498       what she had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made her
## 9499          feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.  He too was much
## 9500         distressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state of
## 9501        embarrassment.--Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on
## 9502      first coming into the room, he could not recollect; but determining to
## 9503        be on the safe side, he made his apology in form as soon as he could
## 9504                                        say any thing, after taking a chair.
## 9505                                                                            
## 9506     &quot;Mrs. Jennings told me,&quot; said he, &quot;that you wished to speak with me, at
## 9507       least I understood her so--or I certainly should not have intruded on
## 9508           you in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have been
## 9509         extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;
## 9510     especially as it will most likely be some time--it is not probable that
## 9511       I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again.  I go to Oxford
## 9512                                                                  tomorrow.&quot;
## 9513                                                                            
## 9514        &quot;You would not have gone, however,&quot; said Elinor, recovering herself,
## 9515              and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as
## 9516       possible, &quot;without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been
## 9517     able to give them in person.  Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she
## 9518     said.  I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on
## 9519              the point of communicating by paper.  I am charged with a most
## 9520         agreeable office (breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke.)
## 9521       Colonel Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to
## 9522      say, that understanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasure
## 9523     in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only wishes
## 9524           it were more valuable.  Allow me to congratulate you on having so
## 9525     respectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that the
## 9526        living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much more considerable,
## 9527             and such as might better enable you to--as might be more than a
## 9528     temporary accommodation to yourself--such, in short, as might establish
## 9529                                               all your views of happiness.&quot;
## 9530                                                                            
## 9531     What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself, it cannot be expected
## 9532       that any one else should say for him.  He LOOKED all the astonishment
## 9533      which such unexpected, such unthought-of information could not fail of
## 9534                                 exciting; but he said only these two words,
## 9535                                                                            
## 9536                                                          &quot;Colonel Brandon!&quot;
## 9537                                                                            
## 9538          &quot;Yes,&quot; continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the
## 9539     worst was over, &quot;Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern
## 9540            for what has lately passed--for the cruel situation in which the
## 9541      unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you--a concern which I
## 9542             am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share; and
## 9543      likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character, and
## 9544      his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion.&quot;
## 9545                                                                            
## 9546                    &quot;Colonel Brandon give ME a living!--Can it be possible?&quot;
## 9547                                                                            
## 9548       &quot;The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find
## 9549                                                      friendship any where.&quot;
## 9550                                                                            
## 9551        &quot;No,&quot; replied he, with sudden consciousness, &quot;not to find it in YOU;
## 9552            for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it
## 9553      all.--I feel it--I would express it if I could--but, as you well know,
## 9554                                                            I am no orator.&quot;
## 9555                                                                            
## 9556     &quot;You are very much mistaken.  I do assure you that you owe it entirely,
## 9557          at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon&#39;s
## 9558         discernment of it.  I have had no hand in it.  I did not even know,
## 9559        till I understood his design, that the living was vacant; nor had it
## 9560       ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift.
## 9561        As a friend of mine, of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he
## 9562     HAS, still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owe
## 9563                                                nothing to my solicitation.&quot;
## 9564                                                                            
## 9565        Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action, but
## 9566      she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of
## 9567            Edward, that she acknowledged it with hesitation; which probably
## 9568            contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently
## 9569      entered it.  For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had
## 9570     ceased to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,
## 9571                                                                            
## 9572     &quot;Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability.  I have
## 9573     always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems him
## 9574     highly.  He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners perfectly
## 9575                                                             the gentleman.&quot;
## 9576                                                                            
## 9577     &quot;Indeed,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;I believe that you will find him, on farther
## 9578         acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be, and as you will be
## 9579         such very near neighbours (for I understand the parsonage is almost
## 9580           close to the mansion-house,) it is particularly important that he
## 9581                                                        SHOULD be all this.&quot;
## 9582                                                                            
## 9583      Edward made no answer; but when she had turned away her head, gave her
## 9584     a look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he
## 9585             might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the
## 9586                                                 mansion-house much greater.
## 9587                                                                            
## 9588       &quot;Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street,&quot; said he, soon
## 9589                                          afterwards, rising from his chair.
## 9590                                                                            
## 9591                                    Elinor told him the number of the house.
## 9592                                                                            
## 9593        &quot;I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will not
## 9594          allow me to give YOU; to assure him that he has made me a very--an
## 9595                                                     exceedingly happy man.&quot;
## 9596                                                                            
## 9597            Elinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted, with a very
## 9598          earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for his
## 9599       happiness in every change of situation that might befall him; on HIS,
## 9600      with rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the power of
## 9601                                                              expressing it.
## 9602                                                                            
## 9603        &quot;When I see him again,&quot; said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him
## 9604                                 out, &quot;I shall see him the husband of Lucy.&quot;
## 9605                                                                            
## 9606         And with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down to reconsider the
## 9607      past, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of
## 9608              Edward; and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent.
## 9609                                                                            
## 9610        When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people
## 9611       whom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have a
## 9612      great deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the important
## 9613       secret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted to
## 9614                                        it again as soon as Elinor appeared.
## 9615                                                                            
## 9616        &quot;Well, my dear,&quot; she cried, &quot;I sent you up the young man.  Did not I
## 9617      do right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty--You did not find
## 9618                                him very unwilling to accept your proposal?&quot;
## 9619                                                                            
## 9620                                      &quot;No, ma&#39;am; THAT was not very likely.&quot;
## 9621                                                                            
## 9622      &quot;Well, and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon
## 9623                                                                      that.&quot;
## 9624                                                                            
## 9625     &quot;Really,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;I know so little of these kind of forms, that I
## 9626               can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation
## 9627              necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his
## 9628                                                                ordination.&quot;
## 9629                                                                            
## 9630      &quot;Two or three months!&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings; &quot;Lord! my dear, how calmly
## 9631          you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord
## 9632     bless me!--I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!--And though
## 9633     one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think
## 9634            it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him.  Sure
## 9635     somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that is in
## 9636                                                            orders already.&quot;
## 9637                                                                            
## 9638          &quot;My dear ma&#39;am,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;what can you be thinking of?-- Why,
## 9639              Colonel Brandon&#39;s only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.&quot;
## 9640                                                                            
## 9641     &quot;Lord bless you, my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the
## 9642          Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr.
## 9643                                                                   Ferrars!&quot;
## 9644                                                                            
## 9645             The deception could not continue after this; and an explanation
## 9646     immediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement for
## 9647      the moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs.
## 9648          Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and still
## 9649                            without forfeiting her expectation of the first.
## 9650                                                                            
## 9651     &quot;Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,&quot; said she, after the first
## 9652      ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, &quot;and very likely MAY
## 9653        be out of repair; but to hear a man apologising, as I thought, for a
## 9654      house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor,
## 9655     and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!--and to
## 9656     you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage!-- It seems quite
## 9657          ridiculous.  But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to do some
## 9658       thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy
## 9659                                                                goes to it.&quot;
## 9660                                                                            
## 9661         &quot;But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living&#39;s
## 9662                                       being enough to allow them to marry.&quot;
## 9663                                                                            
## 9664        &quot;The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-year
## 9665        himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less.  Take my word
## 9666          for it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford
## 9667         Parsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan&#39;t go if Lucy an&#39;t
## 9668                                                                     there.&quot;
## 9669                                                                            
## 9670         Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability of their not
## 9671                                                 waiting for any thing more.
## 9672                                                                            
## 9673                                                                            
## 9674                                                                            
## 9675                                                                  CHAPTER 41
## 9676                                                                            
## 9677                                                                            
## 9678        Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with
## 9679         his happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he
## 9680              reached Bartlett&#39;s Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs.
## 9681                     Jennings, who called on her again the next day with her
## 9682      congratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before in
## 9683                                                                   her life.
## 9684                                                                            
## 9685     Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were at least very certain; and
## 9686          she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their
## 9687     being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.
## 9688      So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness to give Elinor
## 9689              that credit which Edward WOULD give her, that she spoke of her
## 9690        friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was ready to
## 9691       own all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no exertion
## 9692     for their good on Miss Dashwood&#39;s part, either present or future, would
## 9693       ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing any thing in
## 9694     the world for those she really valued.  As for Colonel Brandon, she was
## 9695            not only ready to worship him as a saint, but was moreover truly
## 9696           anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;
## 9697        anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and scarcely
## 9698       resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she possibly could,
## 9699                   of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his poultry.
## 9700                                                                            
## 9701          It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley
## 9702      Street, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his
## 9703       wife&#39;s indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel
## 9704          it necessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation, however,
## 9705           which not only opposed her own inclination, but which had not the
## 9706         assistance of any encouragement from her companions.  Marianne, not
## 9707        contented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to
## 9708            prevent her sister&#39;s going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her
## 9709         carriage was always at Elinor&#39;s service, so very much disliked Mrs.
## 9710      John Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after
## 9711          the late discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking
## 9712        Edward&#39;s part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company
## 9713        again.  The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a
## 9714      visit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run
## 9715      the risk of a tete-a-tete with a woman, whom neither of the others had
## 9716                                                  so much reason to dislike.
## 9717                                                                            
## 9718       Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the
## 9719      house, her husband accidentally came out.  He expressed great pleasure
## 9720          in meeting Elinor, told her that he had been just going to call in
## 9721     Berkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see
## 9722                                                her, invited her to come in.
## 9723                                                                            
## 9724            They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--Nobody was there.
## 9725                                                                            
## 9726          &quot;Fanny is in her own room, I suppose,&quot; said he:--&quot;I will go to her
## 9727       presently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the
## 9728      world to seeing YOU.-- Very far from it, indeed.  NOW especially there
## 9729                  cannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always great
## 9730                                favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?&quot;--
## 9731                                                                            
## 9732                                  Elinor made what excuse she could for her.
## 9733                                                                            
## 9734      &quot;I am not sorry to see you alone,&quot; he replied, &quot;for I have a good deal
## 9735      to say to you.  This living of Colonel Brandon&#39;s--can it be true?--has
## 9736      he really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was
## 9737                      coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.&quot;
## 9738                                                                            
## 9739             &quot;It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given the living of
## 9740                                                        Delaford to Edward.&quot;
## 9741                                                                            
## 9742             &quot;Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no
## 9743                 connection between them!--and now that livings fetch such a
## 9744                                        price!--what was the value of this?&quot;
## 9745                                                                            
## 9746                                                 &quot;About two hundred a year.&quot;
## 9747                                                                            
## 9748               &quot;Very well--and for the next presentation to a living of that
## 9749        value--supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and
## 9750            likely to vacate it soon--he might have got I dare say--fourteen
## 9751     hundred pounds.  And how came he not to have settled that matter before
## 9752     this person&#39;s death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it, but a
## 9753       man of Colonel Brandon&#39;s sense!--I wonder he should be so improvident
## 9754     in a point of such common, such natural, concern!--Well, I am convinced
## 9755            that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human
## 9756          character.  I suppose, however--on recollection--that the case may
## 9757     probably be THIS.  Edward is only to hold the living till the person to
## 9758         whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough to
## 9759                      take it.--Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.&quot;
## 9760                                                                            
## 9761      Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that
## 9762           she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel
## 9763       Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which
## 9764                       it was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.
## 9765                                                                            
## 9766                &quot;It is truly astonishing!&quot;--he cried, after hearing what she
## 9767                                 said--&quot;what could be the Colonel&#39;s motive?&quot;
## 9768                                                                            
## 9769                           &quot;A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.&quot;
## 9770                                                                            
## 9771        &quot;Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky
## 9772       man.--You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I
## 9773      have broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like
## 9774                                                 to hear it much talked of.&quot;
## 9775                                                                            
## 9776         Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she
## 9777     thought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of wealth
## 9778        to her brother, by which neither she nor her child could be possibly
## 9779                                                               impoverished.
## 9780                                                                            
## 9781        &quot;Mrs. Ferrars,&quot; added he, lowering his voice to the tone becoming so
## 9782      important a subject, &quot;knows nothing about it at present, and I believe
## 9783       it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may
## 9784       be.-- When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all.&quot;
## 9785                                                                            
## 9786            &quot;But why should such precaution be used?--Though it is not to be
## 9787            supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in
## 9788       knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be
## 9789         quite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she
## 9790       supposed to feel at all?--She has done with her son, she cast him off
## 9791      for ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast
## 9792           him off likewise.  Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined
## 9793     liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--she cannot
## 9794     be interested in any thing that befalls him.-- She would not be so weak
## 9795      as to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of
## 9796                                                                  a parent!&quot;
## 9797                                                                            
## 9798            &quot;Ah! Elinor,&quot; said John, &quot;your reasoning is very good, but it is
## 9799          founded on ignorance of human nature.  When Edward&#39;s unhappy match
## 9800      takes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had
## 9801             never discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may
## 9802       accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as
## 9803           possible.  Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.&quot;
## 9804                                                                            
## 9805     &quot;You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory
## 9806                                                              by THIS time.&quot;
## 9807                                                                            
## 9808                &quot;You wrong her exceedingly.  Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most
## 9809                                         affectionate mothers in the world.&quot;
## 9810                                                                            
## 9811                                                          Elinor was silent.
## 9812                                                                            
## 9813       &quot;We think NOW,&quot;--said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, &quot;of ROBERT&#39;S
## 9814                                                      marrying Miss Morton.&quot;
## 9815                                                                            
## 9816       Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother&#39;s
## 9817                                                       tone, calmly replied,
## 9818                                                                            
## 9819                         &quot;The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.&quot;
## 9820                                                                            
## 9821                                                 &quot;Choice!--how do you mean?&quot;
## 9822                                                                            
## 9823       &quot;I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be
## 9824                the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert.&quot;
## 9825                                                                            
## 9826          &quot;Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all
## 9827        intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;--and as to any
## 9828      thing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that
## 9829                                              one is superior to the other.&quot;
## 9830                                                                            
## 9831        Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent.--His
## 9832                                                     reflections ended thus.
## 9833                                                                            
## 9834     &quot;Of ONE thing, my dear sister,&quot; kindly taking her hand, and speaking in
## 9835     an awful whisper,--&quot;I may assure you;--and I WILL do it, because I know
## 9836         it must gratify you.  I have good reason to think--indeed I have it
## 9837        from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise it
## 9838       would be very wrong to say any thing about it--but I have it from the
## 9839       very best authority--not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say
## 9840           it herself--but her daughter DID, and I have it from her--That in
## 9841      short, whatever objections there might be against a certain--a certain
## 9842         connection--you understand me--it would have been far preferable to
## 9843       her, it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does.  I
## 9844     was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that
## 9845        light--a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all.  &#39;It would
## 9846     have been beyond comparison,&#39; she said, &#39;the least evil of the two, and
## 9847      she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse.&#39; But however, all
## 9848                  that is quite out of the question--not to be thought of or
## 9849       mentioned--as to any attachment you know--it never could be--all that
## 9850         is gone by.  But I thought I would just tell you of this, because I
## 9851          knew how much it must please you.  Not that you have any reason to
## 9852        regret, my dear Elinor.  There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly
## 9853        well--quite as well, or better, perhaps, all things considered.  Has
## 9854                                      Colonel Brandon been with you lately?&quot;
## 9855                                                                            
## 9856        Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity, and raise her
## 9857      self-importance, to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;--and she was
## 9858      therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply
## 9859             herself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her
## 9860       brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars.  After a few moments&#39;
## 9861      chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her
## 9862      sister&#39;s being there, quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was
## 9863               left to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay
## 9864       unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so
## 9865     unfair a division of his mother&#39;s love and liberality, to the prejudice
## 9866        of his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated course of
## 9867                 life, and that brother&#39;s integrity, was confirming her most
## 9868                                 unfavourable opinion of his head and heart.
## 9869                                                                            
## 9870        They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he began to
## 9871         speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard of the living, and was very
## 9872      inquisitive on the subject.  Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as
## 9873         she had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very
## 9874       different, was not less striking than it had been on HIM.  He laughed
## 9875      most immoderately.  The idea of Edward&#39;s being a clergyman, and living
## 9876       in a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;--and when to
## 9877          that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a
## 9878     white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith
## 9879                  and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.
## 9880                                                                            
## 9881              Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, the
## 9882      conclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from being fixed
## 9883        on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited.  It was a
## 9884        look, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings,
## 9885       and gave no intelligence to him.  He was recalled from wit to wisdom,
## 9886                     not by any reproof of hers, but by his own sensibility.
## 9887                                                                            
## 9888          &quot;We may treat it as a joke,&quot; said he, at last, recovering from the
## 9889     affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety
## 9890     of the moment--&quot;but, upon my soul, it is a most serious business.  Poor
## 9891         Edward!  he is ruined for ever.  I am extremely sorry for it--for I
## 9892       know him to be a very good-hearted creature; as well-meaning a fellow
## 9893              perhaps, as any in the world.  You must not judge of him, Miss
## 9894     Dashwood, from YOUR slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are
## 9895         certainly not the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born, you
## 9896       know, with the same powers,--the same address.-- Poor fellow!--to see
## 9897      him in a circle of strangers!--to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but
## 9898       upon my soul, I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom;
## 9899      and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life, as
## 9900       when it all burst forth.  I could not believe it.-- My mother was the
## 9901      first person who told me of it; and I, feeling myself called on to act
## 9902     with resolution, immediately said to her, &#39;My dear madam, I do not know
## 9903        what you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself, I must
## 9904       say, that if Edward does marry this young woman, I never will see him
## 9905           again.&#39; That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonly
## 9906                     shocked, indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has done for himself
## 9907     completely--shut himself out for ever from all decent society!--but, as
## 9908        I directly said to my mother, I am not in the least surprised at it;
## 9909         from his style of education, it was always to be expected.  My poor
## 9910                                                   mother was half frantic.&quot;
## 9911                                                                            
## 9912                                              &quot;Have you ever seen the lady?&quot;
## 9913                                                                            
## 9914      &quot;Yes; once, while she was staying in this house, I happened to drop in
## 9915         for ten minutes; and I saw quite enough of her.  The merest awkward
## 9916      country girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty.--
## 9917           I remember her perfectly.  Just the kind of girl I should suppose
## 9918      likely to captivate poor Edward.  I offered immediately, as soon as my
## 9919        mother related the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade
## 9920     him from the match; but it was too late THEN, I found, to do any thing,
## 9921        for unluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of it
## 9922          till after the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, you
## 9923              know, to interfere.  But had I been informed of it a few hours
## 9924        earlier--I think it is most probable--that something might have been
## 9925         hit on.  I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very
## 9926     strong light.  &#39;My dear fellow,&#39; I should have said, &#39;consider what you
## 9927        are doing.  You are making a most disgraceful connection, and such a
## 9928            one as your family are unanimous in disapproving.&#39; I cannot help
## 9929        thinking, in short, that means might have been found.  But now it is
## 9930              all too late.  He must be starved, you know;--that is certain;
## 9931                                                        absolutely starved.&quot;
## 9932                                                                            
## 9933      He had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance
## 9934      of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject.  But though SHE never
## 9935        spoke of it out of her own family, Elinor could see its influence on
## 9936     her mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which she
## 9937     entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself.  She
## 9938        even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her
## 9939          sister were so soon to leave town, as she had hoped to see more of
## 9940          them;--an exertion in which her husband, who attended her into the
## 9941      room, and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish every
## 9942                              thing that was most affectionate and graceful.
## 9943                                                                            
## 9944                                                                            
## 9945                                                                            
## 9946                                                                  CHAPTER 42
## 9947                                                                            
## 9948                                                                            
## 9949         One other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor received her
## 9950         brother&#39;s congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton
## 9951       without any expense, and on Colonel Brandon&#39;s being to follow them to
## 9952     Cleveland in a day or two, completed the intercourse of the brother and
## 9953     sisters in town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to Norland
## 9954       whenever it should happen to be in their way, which of all things was
## 9955           the most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less public,
## 9956     assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he should
## 9957       come to see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any meeting in the
## 9958                                                                    country.
## 9959                                                                            
## 9960     It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send
## 9961     her to Delaford;--a place, in which, of all others, she would now least
## 9962        chuse to visit, or wish to reside; for not only was it considered as
## 9963       her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy, when
## 9964             they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there.
## 9965                                                                            
## 9966        Very early in April, and tolerably early in the day, the two parties
## 9967       from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective
## 9968        homes, to meet, by appointment, on the road.  For the convenience of
## 9969        Charlotte and her child, they were to be more than two days on their
## 9970         journey, and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel
## 9971            Brandon, was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.
## 9972                                                                            
## 9973      Marianne, few as had been her hours of comfort in London, and eager as
## 9974     she had long been to quit it, could not, when it came to the point, bid
## 9975         adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those
## 9976      hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby, which were now extinguished
## 9977       for ever, without great pain.  Nor could she leave the place in which
## 9978     Willoughby remained, busy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which
## 9979                       SHE could have no share, without shedding many tears.
## 9980                                                                            
## 9981         Elinor&#39;s satisfaction, at the moment of removal, was more positive.
## 9982       She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on, she left
## 9983     no creature behind, from whom it would give her a moment&#39;s regret to be
## 9984               divided for ever, she was pleased to be free herself from the
## 9985         persecution of Lucy&#39;s friendship, she was grateful for bringing her
## 9986         sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage, and she looked
## 9987       forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might
## 9988      do towards restoring Marianne&#39;s peace of mind, and confirming her own.
## 9989                                                                            
## 9990       Their journey was safely performed.  The second day brought them into
## 9991       the cherished, or the prohibited, county of Somerset, for as such was
## 9992      it dwelt on by turns in Marianne&#39;s imagination; and in the forenoon of
## 9993                                       the third they drove up to Cleveland.
## 9994                                                                            
## 9995         Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built house, situated on a sloping
## 9996              lawn.  It had no park, but the pleasure-grounds were tolerably
## 9997     extensive; and like every other place of the same degree of importance,
## 9998           it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of smooth
## 9999           gravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn was
## 10000    dotted over with timber, the house itself was under the guardianship of
## 10001      the fir, the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of them
## 10002          altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars, shut out the
## 10003                                                                   offices.
## 10004                                                                           
## 10005     Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the
## 10006       consciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton, and not thirty
## 10007          from Combe Magna; and before she had been five minutes within its
## 10008    walls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her child
## 10009        to the housekeeper, she quitted it again, stealing away through the
## 10010         winding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain a
## 10011       distant eminence; where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering
## 10012       over a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest on
## 10013      the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from their
## 10014                                         summits Combe Magna might be seen.
## 10015                                                                           
## 10016      In such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she rejoiced in tears
## 10017    of agony to be at Cleveland; and as she returned by a different circuit
## 10018       to the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty, of
## 10019          wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude, she
## 10020        resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained
## 10021              with the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary rambles.
## 10022                                                                           
## 10023    She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house,
## 10024       on an excursion through its more immediate premises; and the rest of
## 10025          the morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen
## 10026           garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the
## 10027              gardener&#39;s lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the
## 10028     green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants, unwarily exposed,
## 10029                  and nipped by the lingering frost, raised the laughter of
## 10030                Charlotte,--and in visiting her poultry-yard, where, in the
## 10031    disappointed hopes of her dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, or
## 10032       being stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising young
## 10033                               brood, she found fresh sources of merriment.
## 10034                                                                           
## 10035      The morning was fine and dry, and Marianne, in her plan of employment
## 10036     abroad, had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay
## 10037         at Cleveland.  With great surprise therefore, did she find herself
## 10038    prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner.  She had
## 10039    depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhaps all over
## 10040    the grounds, and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred
## 10041     her from it; but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry
## 10042                                           or pleasant weather for walking.
## 10043                                                                           
## 10044     Their party was small, and the hours passed quietly away.  Mrs. Palmer
## 10045       had her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work; they talked of the
## 10046       friends they had left behind, arranged Lady Middleton&#39;s engagements,
## 10047      and wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther
## 10048          than Reading that night.  Elinor, however little concerned in it,
## 10049      joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had the knack of finding
## 10050      her way in every house to the library, however it might be avoided by
## 10051                       the family in general, soon procured herself a book.
## 10052                                                                           
## 10053       Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer&#39;s side that constant and friendly
## 10054           good humour could do, to make them feel themselves welcome.  The
## 10055    openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of
## 10056      recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms
## 10057          of politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty a face, was
## 10058     engaging; her folly, though evident was not disgusting, because it was
## 10059   not conceited; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh.
## 10060                                                                           
## 10061    The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner, affording
## 10062         a pleasant enlargement of the party, and a very welcome variety to
## 10063    their conversation, which a long morning of the same continued rain had
## 10064                                                          reduced very low.
## 10065                                                                           
## 10066    Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that little had seen so
## 10067       much variety in his address to her sister and herself, that she knew
## 10068          not what to expect to find him in his own family.  She found him,
## 10069     however, perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,
## 10070       and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother; she found him
## 10071        very capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from
## 10072         being so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much
## 10073       superior to people in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs.
## 10074    Jennings and Charlotte.  For the rest of his character and habits, they
## 10075        were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all
## 10076           unusual in his sex and time of life.  He was nice in his eating,
## 10077      uncertain in his hours; fond of his child, though affecting to slight
## 10078     it; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been
## 10079         devoted to business.  She liked him, however, upon the whole, much
## 10080      better than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that she
## 10081      could like him no more;--not sorry to be driven by the observation of
## 10082              his Epicurism, his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with
## 10083         complacency on the remembrance of Edward&#39;s generous temper, simple
## 10084                                             taste, and diffident feelings.
## 10085                                                                           
## 10086           Of Edward, or at least of some of his concerns, she now received
## 10087           intelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire
## 10088       lately; and who, treating her at once as the disinterested friend of
## 10089           Mr. Ferrars, and the kind confidante of himself, talked to her a
## 10090       great deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies,
## 10091       and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them.--His
## 10092        behaviour to her in this, as well as in every other particular, his
## 10093        open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days, his
## 10094         readiness to converse with her, and his deference for her opinion,
## 10095      might very well justify Mrs. Jennings&#39;s persuasion of his attachment,
## 10096     and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the
## 10097        first, believed Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it
## 10098       herself.  But as it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her
## 10099         head, except by Mrs. Jennings&#39;s suggestion; and she could not help
## 10100         believing herself the nicest observer of the two;--she watched his
## 10101    eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour;--and while his
## 10102         looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne&#39;s feeling, in her head and
## 10103       throat, the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,
## 10104     entirely escaped the latter lady&#39;s observation;--SHE could discover in
## 10105                    them the quick feelings, and needless alarm of a lover.
## 10106                                                                           
## 10107      Two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her
## 10108        being there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but all
## 10109        over the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them,
## 10110     where there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where the
## 10111          trees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,
## 10112        had--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet
## 10113     shoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a
## 10114        day or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing
## 10115          ailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.
## 10116          Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual, were all
## 10117      declined.  Though heavy and feverish, with a pain in her limbs, and a
## 10118    cough, and a sore throat, a good night&#39;s rest was to cure her entirely;
## 10119     and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her, when she went
## 10120                 to bed, to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies.
## 10121                                                                           
## 10122                                                                           
## 10123                                                                           
## 10124                                                                 CHAPTER 43
## 10125                                                                           
## 10126                                                                           
## 10127       Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time; to every inquiry
## 10128    replied that she was better, and tried to prove herself so, by engaging
## 10129      in her accustomary employments.  But a day spent in sitting shivering
## 10130    over the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable to read, or
## 10131    in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much in favour of
## 10132     her amendment; and when, at last, she went early to bed, more and more
## 10133            indisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister&#39;s
## 10134    composure, who, though attending and nursing her the whole day, against
## 10135      Marianne&#39;s inclination, and forcing proper medicines on her at night,
## 10136        trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of sleep, and
## 10137                                                        felt no real alarm.
## 10138                                                                           
## 10139              A very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed the
## 10140        expectation of both; and when Marianne, after persisting in rising,
## 10141        confessed herself unable to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her
## 10142     bed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings&#39;s advice, of sending
## 10143                                               for the Palmers&#39; apothecary.
## 10144                                                                           
## 10145     He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to
## 10146    expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health, yet, by
## 10147       pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing the
## 10148      word &quot;infection&quot; to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,
## 10149      on her baby&#39;s account.  Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined from the
## 10150          first to think Marianne&#39;s complaint more serious than Elinor, now
## 10151       looked very grave on Mr. Harris&#39;s report, and confirming Charlotte&#39;s
## 10152       fears and caution, urged the necessity of her immediate removal with
## 10153         her infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as
## 10154        idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be
## 10155     withstood.  Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and within an hour
## 10156       after Mr. Harris&#39;s arrival, she set off, with her little boy and his
## 10157       nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer&#39;s, who lived a
## 10158      few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised, at
## 10159     her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two; and whither she was
## 10160    almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her.  Mrs. Jennings,
## 10161       however, with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her,
## 10162          declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as
## 10163     Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring, by her own attentive care,
## 10164       to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from; and
## 10165     Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,
## 10166             desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her better
## 10167                                    experience in nursing, of material use.
## 10168                                                                           
## 10169          Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, and
## 10170        feeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow
## 10171         would find her recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have
## 10172     produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for
## 10173      on that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended
## 10174      the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their
## 10175     mother by surprise on the following forenoon.  The little she said was
## 10176        all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to
## 10177       raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN really believed
## 10178                                herself, that it would be a very short one.
## 10179                                                                           
## 10180          The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the
## 10181       patient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was no
## 10182     amendment, did not appear worse.  Their party was now farther reduced;
## 10183     for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity
## 10184      and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away
## 10185       by his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his
## 10186        promise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel
## 10187      Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going
## 10188    likewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most
## 10189     acceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much
## 10190     uneasiness on her sister&#39;s account, would be to deprive them both, she
## 10191      thought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that his
## 10192    stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him to
## 10193       play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with her
## 10194          sister, &amp;c. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was
## 10195      gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not
## 10196      long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings&#39;s entreaty was
## 10197     warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself,
## 10198       in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss
## 10199                                                 Dashwood in any emergence.
## 10200                                                                           
## 10201      Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements.
## 10202          She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of
## 10203    Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival.  It
## 10204        gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it
## 10205                gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name.
## 10206                                                                           
## 10207      Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer&#39;s departure, and her
## 10208     situation continued, with little variation, the same.  Mr. Harris, who
## 10209      attended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and
## 10210      Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others
## 10211      was by no means so cheerful.  Mrs. Jennings had determined very early
## 10212          in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel
## 10213            Brandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings&#39;s
## 10214     forebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence.  He
## 10215      tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment of
## 10216     the apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each day
## 10217       in which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the
## 10218        admission of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from his
## 10219                   mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.
## 10220                                                                           
## 10221       On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of
## 10222       both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared
## 10223     his patient materially better.  Her pulse was much stronger, and every
## 10224    symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit.  Elinor, confirmed
## 10225        in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her
## 10226    letters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than her
## 10227     friend&#39;s, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them
## 10228    at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able
## 10229                                                                 to travel.
## 10230                                                                           
## 10231       But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.-- Towards the
## 10232       evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and
## 10233       uncomfortable than before.  Her sister, however, still sanguine, was
## 10234        willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of
## 10235        having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering the
## 10236       cordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a
## 10237         slumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects.  Her
## 10238            sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a
## 10239    considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself, she
## 10240           resolved to sit with her during the whole of it.  Mrs. Jennings,
## 10241      knowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to
## 10242         bed; her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating
## 10243          herself in the housekeeper&#39;s room, and Elinor remained alone with
## 10244                                                                  Marianne.
## 10245                                                                           
## 10246           The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her
## 10247    sister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change of
## 10248       posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint
## 10249     which passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful
## 10250    a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in
## 10251   the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness, cried out,--
## 10252                                                                           
## 10253                                                        &quot;Is mama coming?--&quot;
## 10254                                                                           
## 10255           &quot;Not yet,&quot; cried the other, concealing her terror, and assisting
## 10256    Marianne to lie down again, &quot;but she will be here, I hope, before it is
## 10257                 long.  It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton.&quot;
## 10258                                                                           
## 10259         &quot;But she must not go round by London,&quot; cried Marianne, in the same
## 10260           hurried manner.  &quot;I shall never see her, if she goes by London.&quot;
## 10261                                                                           
## 10262     Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, while
## 10263        attempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse.  It was lower and
## 10264        quicker than ever!  and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her
## 10265       alarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantly
## 10266      for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother.
## 10267         To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the
## 10268     latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its
## 10269     performance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by
## 10270       her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew he
## 10271           was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.
## 10272                                                                           
## 10273        It was no time for hesitation.  Her fears and her difficulties were
## 10274    immediately before him.  Her fears, he had no courage, no confidence to
## 10275   attempt the removal of:--he listened to them in silent despondence;--but
## 10276        her difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that
## 10277    seemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his mind,
## 10278        he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.
## 10279    Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She thanked him
## 10280   with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to hurry off his
## 10281         servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for post-horses
## 10282                             directly, she wrote a few lines to her mother.
## 10283                                                                           
## 10284    The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon--or such
## 10285      a companion for her mother,--how gratefully was it felt!--a companion
## 10286       whose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve, and whose
## 10287        friendship might soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summons
## 10288       COULD be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,
## 10289                                                           would lessen it.
## 10290                                                                           
## 10291    HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness of a
## 10292           collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost
## 10293        despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might
## 10294     look for his return.  Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.  The
## 10295        horses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon
## 10296    only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words spoken
## 10297    too low to reach her ear, hurried into the carriage.  It was then about
## 10298     twelve o&#39;clock, and she returned to her sister&#39;s apartment to wait for
## 10299         the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the rest of the
## 10300      night.  It was a night of almost equal suffering to both.  Hour after
## 10301    hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne&#39;s side, and
## 10302    in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor&#39;s, before Mr. Harris appeared.  Her
## 10303         apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all her former
## 10304     security; and the servant who sat up with her, for she would not allow
## 10305       Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her more, by hints of what
## 10306                                           her mistress had always thought.
## 10307                                                                           
## 10308       Marianne&#39;s ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her
## 10309         mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the
## 10310     heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with
## 10311           so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,
## 10312        fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had
## 10313        been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother
## 10314       arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.
## 10315                                                                           
## 10316       She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if HE could
## 10317       not come, for some other advice, when the former--but not till after
## 10318      five o&#39;clock--arrived.  His opinion, however, made some little amends
## 10319              for his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and
## 10320     unpleasant alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to
## 10321      be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment
## 10322             must procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was
## 10323        communicated to Elinor.  He promised to call again in the course of
## 10324             three or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious
## 10325                            attendant more composed than he had found them.
## 10326                                                                           
## 10327      With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to
## 10328       their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.
## 10329    Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her no
## 10330      doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, her
## 10331         conviction of her sister&#39;s danger would not allow her to offer the
## 10332      comfort of hope.  Her heart was really grieved.  The rapid decay, the
## 10333    early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have struck
## 10334      a less interested person with concern.  On Mrs. Jennings&#39;s compassion
## 10335    she had other claims.  She had been for three months her companion, was
## 10336      still under her care, and she was known to have been greatly injured,
## 10337          and long unhappy.  The distress of her sister too, particularly a
## 10338    favourite, was before her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings
## 10339    considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to
## 10340                  herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere.
## 10341                                                                           
## 10342            Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;--but he came to be
## 10343             disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce.  His
## 10344      medicines had failed;--the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more
## 10345     quiet--not more herself--remained in a heavy stupor.  Elinor, catching
## 10346         all, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in
## 10347      further advice.  But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something
## 10348       more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as
## 10349            confident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging
## 10350    assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss
## 10351    Dashwood.  She was calm, except when she thought of her mother; but she
## 10352            was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till noon,
## 10353       scarcely stirring from her sister&#39;s bed, her thoughts wandering from
## 10354       one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her spirits
## 10355          oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, who
## 10356    scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the
## 10357       many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne&#39;s disappointment
## 10358    had brought on.  Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it
## 10359                                      gave fresh misery to her reflections.
## 10360                                                                           
## 10361             About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a dread of
## 10362            disappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her
## 10363     friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her
## 10364            sister&#39;s pulse;--she waited, watched, and examined it again and
## 10365        again;--and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under
## 10366            exterior calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to
## 10367      communicate her hopes.  Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,
## 10368    to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from
## 10369    indulging a thought of its continuance;--and Elinor, conning over every
## 10370     injunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope.  But it was
## 10371           too late.  Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious
## 10372      flutter, she bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what.
## 10373      Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her.
## 10374      Others even arose to confirm it.  Her breath, her skin, her lips, all
## 10375      flattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes
## 10376        on her with a rational, though languid, gaze.  Anxiety and hope now
## 10377     oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity
## 10378      till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o&#39;clock;--when his assurances,
## 10379          his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his
## 10380               expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.
## 10381                                                                           
## 10382       Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her
## 10383         entirely out of danger.  Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the
## 10384     partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their
## 10385        late alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,
## 10386            with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the
## 10387                                         probability of an entire recovery.
## 10388                                                                           
## 10389    Elinor could not be cheerful.  Her joy was of a different kind, and led
## 10390    to any thing rather than to gaiety.  Marianne restored to life, health,
## 10391      friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with
## 10392                  sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent
## 10393      gratitude;--but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,
## 10394        no smiles.  All within Elinor&#39;s breast was satisfaction, silent and
## 10395                                                                    strong.
## 10396                                                                           
## 10397      She continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the
## 10398       whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her
## 10399      enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every
## 10400      look and every breath.  The possibility of a relapse would of course,
## 10401     in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was--but when she
## 10402         saw, on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of
## 10403     recovery continued, and saw Marianne at six o&#39;clock sink into a quiet,
## 10404       steady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every
## 10405                                                                     doubt.
## 10406                                                                           
## 10407        The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected
## 10408         back.  At ten o&#39;clock, she trusted, or at least not much later her
## 10409      mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must
## 10410       now be travelling towards them.  The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely
## 10411      less an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress of time which
## 10412                                                yet kept them in ignorance!
## 10413                                                                           
## 10414        At seven o&#39;clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined
## 10415       Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea.  Of breakfast she had been
## 10416      kept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating
## 10417       much;--and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of
## 10418     content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome.  Mrs. Jennings
## 10419      would have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before
## 10420     her mother&#39;s arrival, and allow HER to take her place by Marianne; but
## 10421      Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that moment
## 10422              about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an
## 10423      unnecessary instant.  Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs
## 10424        into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,
## 10425    left her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to her
## 10426                                       own room to write letters and sleep.
## 10427                                                                           
## 10428       The night was cold and stormy.  The wind roared round the house, and
## 10429       the rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,
## 10430              regarded it not.  Marianne slept through every blast; and the
## 10431             travellers--they had a rich reward in store, for every present
## 10432                                                             inconvenience.
## 10433                                                                           
## 10434           The clock struck eight.  Had it been ten, Elinor would have been
## 10435       convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the
## 10436      house; and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite of the
## 10437      ALMOST impossibility of their being already come, that she moved into
## 10438           the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be
## 10439           satisfied of the truth.  She instantly saw that her ears had not
## 10440         deceived her.  The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in
## 10441     view.  By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be
## 10442       drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor
## 10443         mother&#39;s alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.
## 10444                                                                           
## 10445       Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at
## 10446      that moment.  The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the
## 10447           carriage stopt at the door--of her doubt--her dread--perhaps her
## 10448         despair!--and of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was
## 10449     impossible to be calm.  All that remained to be done was to be speedy;
## 10450      and, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings&#39;s maid
## 10451                                  with her sister, she hurried down stairs.
## 10452                                                                           
## 10453           The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby,
## 10454        assured her that they were already in the house.  She rushed to the
## 10455                   drawing-room,--she entered it,--and saw only Willoughby.
## 10456                                                                           
## 10457                                                                           
## 10458                                                                           
## 10459                                                                 CHAPTER 44
## 10460                                                                           
## 10461                                                                           
## 10462    Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him, obeyed
## 10463      the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room,
## 10464     and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was suspended by
## 10465       his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of command than
## 10466                                                              supplication,
## 10467                                                                           
## 10468        &quot;Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--I entreat you to
## 10469                                                                     stay.&quot;
## 10470                                                                           
## 10471    &quot;No, sir,&quot; she replied with firmness, &quot;I shall NOT stay.  Your business
## 10472       cannot be with ME.  The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell you that
## 10473                                          Mr. Palmer was not in the house.&quot;
## 10474                                                                           
## 10475      &quot;Had they told me,&quot; he cried with vehemence, &quot;that Mr. Palmer and all
## 10476      his relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from the
## 10477                             door.  My business is with you, and only you.&quot;
## 10478                                                                           
## 10479     &quot;With me!&quot;--in the utmost amazement--&quot;well, sir,--be quick--and if you
## 10480                                                        can--less violent.&quot;
## 10481                                                                           
## 10482                                            &quot;Sit down, and I will be both.&quot;
## 10483                                                                           
## 10484        She hesitated; she knew not what to do.  The possibility of Colonel
## 10485    Brandon&#39;s arriving and finding her there, came across her.  But she had
## 10486         promised to hear him, and her curiosity no less than her honor was
## 10487        engaged.  After a moment&#39;s recollection, therefore, concluding that
## 10488           prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would best
## 10489       promote it, she walked silently towards the table, and sat down.  He
## 10490      took the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by
## 10491                                                                    either.
## 10492                                                                           
## 10493       &quot;Pray be quick, sir,&quot;--said Elinor, impatiently;--&quot;I have no time to
## 10494                                                                    spare.&quot;
## 10495                                                                           
## 10496        He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to
## 10497                                                                  hear her.
## 10498                                                                           
## 10499      &quot;Your sister,&quot; said he, with abruptness, a moment afterwards--&quot;is out
## 10500       of danger.  I heard it from the servant.  God be praised!--But is it
## 10501                                                  true? is it really true?&quot;
## 10502                                                                           
## 10503          Elinor would not speak.  He repeated the inquiry with yet greater
## 10504                                                                 eagerness.
## 10505                                                                           
## 10506             &quot;For God&#39;s sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?&quot;
## 10507                                                                           
## 10508                                                          &quot;We hope she is.&quot;
## 10509                                                                           
## 10510                                    He rose up, and walked across the room.
## 10511                                                                           
## 10512     &quot;Had I known as much half an hour ago--But since I AM here,&quot;--speaking
## 10513           with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat--&quot;what does it
## 10514               signify?--For once, Miss Dashwood--it will be the last time,
## 10515             perhaps--let us be cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for
## 10516               gaiety.-- Tell me honestly&quot;--a deeper glow overspreading his
## 10517                          cheeks--&quot;do you think me most a knave or a fool?&quot;
## 10518                                                                           
## 10519    Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever.  She began to
## 10520     think that he must be in liquor;--the strangeness of such a visit, and
## 10521           of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this
## 10522                                   impression she immediately rose, saying,
## 10523                                                                           
## 10524      &quot;Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe--I am not
## 10525      at leisure to remain with you longer.-- Whatever your business may be
## 10526           with me, it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow.&quot;
## 10527                                                                           
## 10528      &quot;I understand you,&quot; he replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice
## 10529     perfectly calm; &quot;yes, I am very drunk.-- A pint of porter with my cold
## 10530                            beef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me.&quot;
## 10531                                                                           
## 10532     &quot;At Marlborough!&quot;--cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand
## 10533                                                       what he would be at.
## 10534                                                                           
## 10535       &quot;Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o&#39;clock, and the only ten
## 10536        minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a
## 10537                                                  nuncheon at Marlborough.&quot;
## 10538                                                                           
## 10539        The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence of his eye as he
## 10540     spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might
## 10541      bring him to Cleveland, he was not brought there by intoxication, she
## 10542                                       said, after a moment&#39;s recollection,
## 10543                                                                           
## 10544    &quot;Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly DO--that after what
## 10545     has passed--your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself upon
## 10546        my notice, requires a very particular excuse.--What is it, that you
## 10547                                                             mean by it?&quot;--
## 10548                                                                           
## 10549    &quot;I mean,&quot;--said he, with serious energy--&quot;if I can, to make you hate me
## 10550             one degree less than you do NOW.  I mean to offer some kind of
## 10551    explanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart
## 10552            to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a
## 10553       blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like
## 10554                                    forgiveness from Ma--from your sister.&quot;
## 10555                                                                           
## 10556                                  &quot;Is this the real reason of your coming?&quot;
## 10557                                                                           
## 10558     &quot;Upon my soul it is,&quot;--was his answer, with a warmth which brought all
## 10559     the former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of herself made
## 10560                                                     her think him sincere.
## 10561                                                                           
## 10562     &quot;If that is all, you may be satisfied already,--for Marianne DOES--she
## 10563                                                    has LONG forgiven you.&quot;
## 10564                                                                           
## 10565     &quot;Has she?&quot;--he cried, in the same eager tone.-- &quot;Then she has forgiven
## 10566      me before she ought to have done it.  But she shall forgive me again,
## 10567               and on more reasonable grounds.--NOW will you listen to me?&quot;
## 10568                                                                           
## 10569                                                   Elinor bowed her assent.
## 10570                                                                           
## 10571    &quot;I do not know,&quot; said he, after a pause of expectation on her side, and
## 10572             thoughtfulness on his own,--&quot;how YOU may have accounted for my
## 10573           behaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have
## 10574    imputed to me.-- Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is
## 10575     worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing.  When I first
## 10576    became intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other view
## 10577    in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged
## 10578      to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.
## 10579          Your sister&#39;s lovely person and interesting manners could not but
## 10580         please me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a
## 10581       kind--It is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what SHE
## 10582    was, that my heart should have been so insensible!  But at first I must
## 10583    confess, my vanity only was elevated by it.  Careless of her happiness,
## 10584      thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had
## 10585    always been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every
## 10586      means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any design
## 10587                                               of returning her affection.&quot;
## 10588                                                                           
## 10589        Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him with the most
## 10590                                    angry contempt, stopped him, by saying,
## 10591                                                                           
## 10592    &quot;It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for me
## 10593      to listen any longer.  Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by
## 10594      any thing.-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the
## 10595                                                                  subject.&quot;
## 10596                                                                           
## 10597     &quot;I insist on you hearing the whole of it,&quot; he replied, &quot;My fortune was
## 10598       never large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of
## 10599    associating with people of better income than myself.  Every year since
## 10600    my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and
## 10601     though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yet
## 10602      that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for
## 10603      some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a
## 10604     woman of fortune.  To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was not
## 10605               a thing to be thought of;--and with a meanness, selfishness,
## 10606     cruelty--which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, Miss
## 10607        Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I was acting in this manner,
## 10608       trying to engage her regard, without a thought of returning it.--But
## 10609         one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish
## 10610     vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated, because I
## 10611    did not THEN know what it was to love.  But have I ever known it?--Well
## 10612     may it be doubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my
## 10613            feelings to vanity, to avarice?--or, what is more, could I have
## 10614    sacrificed hers?-- But I have done it.  To avoid a comparative poverty,
## 10615         which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its
## 10616     horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence, lost every thing that
## 10617                                                 could make it a blessing.&quot;
## 10618                                                                           
## 10619       &quot;You did then,&quot; said Elinor, a little softened, &quot;believe yourself at
## 10620                                                 one time attached to her?&quot;
## 10621                                                                           
## 10622                 &quot;To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such
## 10623       tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have done it?--Yes, I
## 10624        found myself, by insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the
## 10625        happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my
## 10626      intentions were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.  Even
## 10627      THEN, however, when fully determined on paying my addresses to her, I
## 10628     allowed myself most improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment
## 10629    of doing it, from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my
## 10630    circumstances were so greatly embarrassed.  I will not reason here--nor
## 10631      will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse than
## 10632     absurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already
## 10633    bound.  The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing with
## 10634           great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself
## 10635       contemptible and wretched for ever.  At last, however, my resolution
## 10636      was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone,
## 10637         to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and openly
## 10638         assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to
## 10639    display.  But in the interim--in the interim of the very few hours that
## 10640      were to pass, before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her
## 10641      in private--a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin
## 10642           all my resolution, and with it all my comfort.  A discovery took
## 10643    place,&quot;--here he hesitated and looked down.--&quot;Mrs. Smith had somehow or
## 10644    other been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest
## 10645      it was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connection--but I
## 10646         need not explain myself farther,&quot; he added, looking at her with an
## 10647     heightened colour and an enquiring eye--&quot;your particular intimacy--you
## 10648                             have probably heard the whole story long ago.&quot;
## 10649                                                                           
## 10650     &quot;I have,&quot; returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her heart
## 10651    anew against any compassion for him, &quot;I have heard it all.  And how you
## 10652      will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I
## 10653                                       confess is beyond my comprehension.&quot;
## 10654                                                                           
## 10655         &quot;Remember,&quot; cried Willoughby, &quot;from whom you received the account.
## 10656    Could it be an impartial one?  I acknowledge that her situation and her
## 10657    character ought to have been respected by me.  I do not mean to justify
## 10658       myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have
## 10659      nothing to urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,
## 10660    and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.  If the violence of
## 10661            her passions, the weakness of her understanding--I do not mean,
## 10662           however, to defend myself.  Her affection for me deserved better
## 10663    treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness
## 10664     which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return.  I
## 10665     wish--I heartily wish it had never been.  But I have injured more than
## 10666        herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for me--(may I say
## 10667             it?) was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose mind--Oh! how
## 10668                                                    infinitely superior!&quot;--
## 10669                                                                           
## 10670     &quot;Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl--I must say
## 10671          it, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well
## 10672     be--your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her.  Do
## 10673          not think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of
## 10674      understanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.
## 10675              You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in
## 10676       Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she was
## 10677                                       reduced to the extremest indigence.&quot;
## 10678                                                                           
## 10679      &quot;But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it,&quot; he warmly replied; &quot;I did not
## 10680    recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction; and common sense
## 10681                                   might have told her how to find it out.&quot;
## 10682                                                                           
## 10683                                     &quot;Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?&quot;
## 10684                                                                           
## 10685            &quot;She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be
## 10686        guessed.  The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her
## 10687     ignorance of the world--every thing was against me.  The matter itself
## 10688      I could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it.  She was
## 10689     previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in
## 10690     general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,
## 10691       the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my
## 10692    present visit.  In short, it ended in a total breach.  By one measure I
## 10693       might have saved myself.  In the height of her morality, good woman!
## 10694       she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza.  That could
## 10695        not be--and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house.
## 10696         The night following this affair--I was to go the next morning--was
## 10697      spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be.  The
## 10698     struggle was great--but it ended too soon.  My affection for Marianne,
## 10699    my thorough conviction of her attachment to me--it was all insufficient
## 10700        to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false
## 10701        ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to
## 10702        feel, and expensive society had increased.  I had reason to believe
## 10703         myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her, and I
## 10704    persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained
## 10705      for me to do.  A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave
## 10706         Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day; some
## 10707      apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement.  But
## 10708        whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in person, was a
## 10709     point of long debate.  To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and
## 10710               I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep to my
## 10711     resolution.  In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,
## 10712       as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw her miserable,
## 10713       and left her miserable--and left her hoping never to see her again.&quot;
## 10714                                                                           
## 10715    &quot;Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?&quot; said Elinor, reproachfully; &quot;a note
## 10716        would have answered every purpose.-- Why was it necessary to call?&quot;
## 10717                                                                           
## 10718          &quot;It was necessary to my own pride.  I could not bear to leave the
## 10719                country in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of the
## 10720       neighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between
## 10721          Mrs. Smith and myself--and I resolved therefore on calling at the
## 10722    cottage, in my way to Honiton.  The sight of your dear sister, however,
## 10723       was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter, I found her alone.
## 10724    You were all gone I do not know where.  I had left her only the evening
## 10725     before, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on doing right!  A
## 10726      few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever; and I remember how
## 10727            happy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage to
## 10728        Allenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body!  But in
## 10729      this, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with a sense
## 10730           of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling.  Her
## 10731    sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told her that I was
## 10732           obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I never shall forget
## 10733             it--united too with such reliance, such confidence in me!--Oh,
## 10734                                   God!--what a hard-hearted rascal I was!&quot;
## 10735                                                                           
## 10736              They were both silent for a few moments.  Elinor first spoke.
## 10737                                                                           
## 10738                            &quot;Did you tell her that you should soon return?&quot;
## 10739                                                                           
## 10740       &quot;I do not know what I told her,&quot; he replied, impatiently; &quot;less than
## 10741       was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more
## 10742         than was justified by the future.  I cannot think of it.--It won&#39;t
## 10743        do.--Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her
## 10744          kindness and confidence.  Thank Heaven! it DID torture me.  I was
## 10745       miserable.  Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it
## 10746     gives me to look back on my own misery.  I owe such a grudge to myself
## 10747           for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my past
## 10748    sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now.  Well, I
## 10749     went, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was
## 10750      only indifferent.  My journey to town--travelling with my own horses,
## 10751    and therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my own reflections
## 10752        so cheerful--when I looked forward every thing so inviting!--when I
## 10753      looked back at Barton, the picture so soothing!--oh, it was a blessed
## 10754                                                                  journey!&quot;
## 10755                                                                           
## 10756                                                                He stopped.
## 10757                                                                           
## 10758      &quot;Well, sir,&quot; said Elinor, who, though pitying him, grew impatient for
## 10759                                          his departure, &quot;and this is all?&quot;
## 10760                                                                           
## 10761            &quot;Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?-- That infamous
## 10762                                              letter--Did she shew it you?&quot;
## 10763                                                                           
## 10764                                       &quot;Yes, I saw every note that passed.&quot;
## 10765                                                                           
## 10766    &quot;When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did, for I was in
## 10767      town the whole time,) what I felt is--in the common phrase, not to be
## 10768           expressed; in a more simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any
## 10769      emotion--my feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every word
## 10770     was--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here,
## 10771     would forbid--a dagger to my heart.  To know that Marianne was in town
## 10772                was--in the same language--a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and
## 10773          daggers!--what a reproof would she have given me!--her taste, her
## 10774     opinions--I believe they are better known to me than my own,--and I am
## 10775                                                     sure they are dearer.&quot;
## 10776                                                                           
## 10777     Elinor&#39;s heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this
## 10778       extraordinary conversation, was now softened again;--yet she felt it
## 10779                 her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last.
## 10780                                                                           
## 10781        &quot;This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that you are married.
## 10782   Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear.&quot;
## 10783                                                                           
## 10784     &quot;Marianne&#39;s note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in
## 10785             former days, that in spite of the many, many weeks we had been
## 10786         separated, she was as constant in her own feelings, and as full of
## 10787    faith in the constancy of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.  I say
## 10788        awakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had in
## 10789            some measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardened
## 10790     villain, fancying myself indifferent to her, and chusing to fancy that
## 10791       she too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of our
## 10792         past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my
## 10793          shoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,
## 10794     overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, &#39;I shall be
## 10795        heartily glad to hear she is well married.&#39;-- But this note made me
## 10796      know myself better.  I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than
## 10797    any other woman in the world, and that I was using her infamously.  But
## 10798    every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me.  To retreat
## 10799      was impossible.  All that I had to do, was to avoid you both.  I sent
## 10800       no answer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from her
## 10801     farther notice; and for some time I was even determined not to call in
## 10802     Berkeley Street;--but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of a
## 10803     cool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all safely
## 10804                           out of the house one morning, and left my name.&quot;
## 10805                                                                           
## 10806                                             &quot;Watched us out of the house!&quot;
## 10807                                                                           
## 10808     &quot;Even so.  You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how
## 10809    often I was on the point of falling in with you.  I have entered many a
## 10810      shop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by.  Lodging as I did
## 10811          in Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a
## 10812          glimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant
## 10813       watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep
## 10814         out of your sight, could have separated us so long.  I avoided the
## 10815          Middletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who was
## 10816    likely to prove an acquaintance in common.  Not aware of their being in
## 10817    town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of his
## 10818    coming, and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings&#39;s.  He asked me
## 10819    to a party, a dance at his house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as
## 10820     an inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I should have
## 10821           felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him.  The next
## 10822      morning brought another short note from Marianne--still affectionate,
## 10823       open, artless, confiding--everything that could make MY conduct most
## 10824           hateful.  I could not answer it.  I tried--but could not frame a
## 10825       sentence.  But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day.
## 10826       If you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was THEN.
## 10827       With my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play the
## 10828        happy lover to another woman!--Those three or four weeks were worse
## 10829       than all.  Well, at last, as I need not tell you, you were forced on
## 10830     me; and what a sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!--
## 10831      Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me Willoughby in
## 10832       such a tone!--Oh, God!--holding out her hand to me, asking me for an
## 10833             explanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking
## 10834      solicitude on my face!--and Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other
## 10835          hand, looking all that was--Well, it does not signify; it is over
## 10836       now.-- Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could;
## 10837                but not before I had seen Marianne&#39;s sweet face as white as
## 10838          death.--THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;--the last
## 10839    manner in which she appeared to me.  It was a horrid sight!--yet when I
## 10840      thought of her to-day as really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me
## 10841      to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those, who saw
## 10842     her last in this world.  She was before me, constantly before me, as I
## 10843                                      travelled, in the same look and hue.&quot;
## 10844                                                                           
## 10845        A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded.  Willoughby first
## 10846                                            rousing himself, broke it thus:
## 10847                                                                           
## 10848    &quot;Well, let me make haste and be gone.  Your sister is certainly better,
## 10849                                                  certainly out of danger?&quot;
## 10850                                                                           
## 10851                                                    &quot;We are assured of it.&quot;
## 10852                                                                           
## 10853                              &quot;Your poor mother, too!--doting on Marianne.&quot;
## 10854                                                                           
## 10855    &quot;But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; have you any thing to
## 10856                                                           say about that?&quot;
## 10857                                                                           
## 10858         &quot;Yes, yes, THAT in particular.  Your sister wrote to me again, you
## 10859                know, the very next morning.  You saw what she said.  I was
## 10860       breakfasting at the Ellisons,--and her letter, with some others, was
## 10861       brought to me there from my lodgings.  It happened to catch Sophia&#39;s
## 10862    eye before it caught mine--and its size, the elegance of the paper, the
## 10863     hand-writing altogether, immediately gave her a suspicion.  Some vague
## 10864       report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in
## 10865       Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation the preceding
## 10866       evening had marked who the young lady was, and made her more jealous
## 10867         than ever.  Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is
## 10868           delightful in a woman one loves, she opened the letter directly,
## 10869               and read its contents.  She was well paid for her impudence.
## 10870            She read what made her wretched.  Her wretchedness I could have
## 10871     borne, but her passion--her malice--At all events it must be appeased.
## 10872                     And, in short--what do you think of my wife&#39;s style of
## 10873            letter-writing?--delicate--tender--truly feminine--was it not?&quot;
## 10874                                                                           
## 10875                     &quot;Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand-writing.&quot;
## 10876                                                                           
## 10877     &quot;Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as
## 10878    I was ashamed to put my name to.  The original was all her own--her own
## 10879          happy thoughts and gentle diction.  But what could I do!--we were
## 10880        engaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But I am
## 10881       talking like a fool.  Preparation!--day!--In honest words, her money
## 10882     was necessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be
## 10883       done to prevent a rupture.  And after all, what did it signify to my
## 10884     character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language
## 10885    my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end.  My business
## 10886    was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with a bow or a
## 10887         bluster was of little importance.-- &#39;I am ruined for ever in their
## 10888            opinion--&#39; said I to myself--&#39;I am shut out for ever from their
## 10889    society, they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter will
## 10890    only make them think me a blackguard one.&#39; Such were my reasonings, as,
## 10891         in a sort of desperate carelessness, I copied my wife&#39;s words, and
## 10892       parted with the last relics of Marianne.  Her three notes--unluckily
## 10893              they were all in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their
## 10894     existence, and hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put them up, and
## 10895     could not even kiss them.  And the lock of hair--that too I had always
## 10896        carried about me in the same pocket-book, which was now searched by
## 10897     Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,--the dear lock--all, every
## 10898                                                 memento was torn from me.&quot;
## 10899                                                                           
## 10900    &quot;You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,&quot; said Elinor, while
## 10901        her voice, in spite of herself, betrayed her compassionate emotion;
## 10902       &quot;you ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my
## 10903    sister.  You had made your own choice.  It was not forced on you.  Your
## 10904       wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect, at least.  She
## 10905      must be attached to you, or she would not have married you.  To treat
## 10906        her with unkindness, to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to
## 10907           Marianne--nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience.&quot;
## 10908                                                                           
## 10909     &quot;Do not talk to me of my wife,&quot; said he with a heavy sigh.-- &quot;She does
## 10910     not deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no regard for her when we
## 10911        married.--Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be
## 10912     happy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity
## 10913      me, Miss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?-- Am I--be
## 10914            it only one degree--am I less guilty in your opinion than I was
## 10915       before?--My intentions were not always wrong.  Have I explained away
## 10916                                                     any part of my guilt?&quot;
## 10917                                                                           
## 10918    &quot;Yes, you have certainly removed something--a little.-- You have proved
## 10919     yourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had believed you.  You have
## 10920             proved your heart less wicked, much less wicked.  But I hardly
## 10921    know--the misery that you have inflicted--I hardly know what could have
## 10922                                                            made it worse.&quot;
## 10923                                                                           
## 10924    &quot;Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered, what I have been
## 10925      telling you?--Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well
## 10926     as in yours.  You tell me that she has forgiven me already.  Let me be
## 10927       able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present
## 10928        feelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more
## 10929         gentle, less dignified, forgiveness.  Tell her of my misery and my
## 10930      penitence--tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if
## 10931              you will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever.&quot;
## 10932                                                                           
## 10933        &quot;I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be
## 10934          called, your justification.  But you have not explained to me the
## 10935   particular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her illness.&quot;
## 10936                                                                           
## 10937    &quot;Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton, and
## 10938    when he saw who I was--for the first time these two months--he spoke to
## 10939         me.--That he had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen without
## 10940    surprise or resentment.  Now, however, his good-natured, honest, stupid
## 10941         soul, full of indignation against me, and concern for your sister,
## 10942           could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought
## 10943        to--though probably he did not think it WOULD--vex me horridly.  As
## 10944          bluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne
## 10945           Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a letter that
## 10946               morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most
## 10947    imminent--the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &amp;c.--I was too much
## 10948            shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the
## 10949      undiscerning Sir John.  His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer;
## 10950         and so much of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted, he
## 10951         almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise
## 10952        about a pointer puppy.  What I felt on hearing that your sister was
## 10953        dying--and dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth,
## 10954       scorning, hating me in her latest moments--for how could I tell what
## 10955        horrid projects might not have been imputed?  ONE person I was sure
## 10956               would represent me as capable of any thing-- What I felt was
## 10957          dreadful!--My resolution was soon made, and at eight o&#39;clock this
## 10958                          morning I was in my carriage.  Now you know all.&quot;
## 10959                                                                           
## 10960            Elinor made no answer.  Her thoughts were silently fixed on the
## 10961      irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent
## 10962     habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the
## 10963       character, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person
## 10964         and talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a
## 10965      feeling, affectionate temper.  The world had made him extravagant and
## 10966       vain--Extravagance and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish.
## 10967    Vanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another,
## 10968     had involved him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least
## 10969      its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed.  Each faulty
## 10970     propensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to punishment.
## 10971        The attachment, from which against honour, against feeling, against
## 10972          every better interest he had outwardly torn himself, now, when no
## 10973      longer allowable, governed every thought; and the connection, for the
## 10974      sake of which he had, with little scruple, left her sister to misery,
## 10975       was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more
## 10976     incurable nature.  From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the
## 10977     end of some minutes by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie
## 10978         at least equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and
## 10979                                                                     said--
## 10980                                                                           
## 10981                          &quot;There is no use in staying here; I must be off.&quot;
## 10982                                                                           
## 10983                                              &quot;Are you going back to town?&quot;
## 10984                                                                           
## 10985      &quot;No--to Combe Magna.  I have business there; from thence to town in a
## 10986                                                    day or two.  Good bye.&quot;
## 10987                                                                           
## 10988          He held out his hand.  She could not refuse to give him hers;--he
## 10989                                                 pressed it with affection.
## 10990                                                                           
## 10991          &quot;And you DO think something better of me than you did?&quot;--said he,
## 10992     letting it fall, and leaning against the mantel-piece as if forgetting
## 10993                                                              he was to go.
## 10994                                                                           
## 10995     Elinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave, pitied, wished him
## 10996          well--was even interested in his happiness--and added some gentle
## 10997     counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it.  His answer was
## 10998                                                      not very encouraging.
## 10999                                                                           
## 11000     &quot;As to that,&quot; said he, &quot;I must rub through the world as well as I can.
## 11001      Domestic happiness is out of the question.  If, however, I am allowed
## 11002    to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions, it
## 11003           may be the means--it may put me on my guard--at least, it may be
## 11004        something to live for.  Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.
## 11005                      Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again--&quot;
## 11006                                                                           
## 11007                                         Elinor stopped him with a reproof.
## 11008                                                                           
## 11009     &quot;Well,&quot;--he replied--&quot;once more good bye. I shall now go away and live
## 11010                                                    in dread of one event.&quot;
## 11011                                                                           
## 11012                                                        &quot;What do you mean?&quot;
## 11013                                                                           
## 11014                                                  &quot;Your sister&#39;s marriage.&quot;
## 11015                                                                           
## 11016        &quot;You are very wrong.  She can never be more lost to you than she is
## 11017                                                                      now.&quot;
## 11018                                                                           
## 11019     &quot;But she will be gained by some one else.  And if that some one should
## 11020     be the very he whom, of all others, I could least bear--but I will not
## 11021     stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing that
## 11022       where I have most injured I can least forgive.  Good bye,--God bless
## 11023                                                                      you!&quot;
## 11024                                                                           
## 11025                       And with these words, he almost ran out of the room.
## 11026                                                                           
## 11027                                                                           
## 11028                                                                           
## 11029                                                                 CHAPTER 45
## 11030                                                                           
## 11031                                                                           
## 11032      Elinor, for some time after he left her, for some time even after the
## 11033      sound of his carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a
## 11034       crowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness
## 11035                       was the general result, to think even of her sister.
## 11036                                                                           
## 11037    Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most
## 11038        worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited a
## 11039    degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which made
## 11040         her think of him as now separated for ever from her family, with a
## 11041       tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledged
## 11042       within herself--to his wishes than to his merits.  She felt that his
## 11043    influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not
## 11044      in reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction, that
## 11045    open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to possess;
## 11046          and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not even
## 11047       innocent to indulge.  But she felt that it was so, long, long before
## 11048                                         she could feel his influence less.
## 11049                                                                           
## 11050       When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne, she found her
## 11051      just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of
## 11052           her hopes.  Elinor&#39;s heart was full.  The past, the present, the
## 11053            future, Willoughby&#39;s visit, Marianne&#39;s safety, and her mother&#39;s
## 11054        expected arrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits
## 11055      which kept off every indication of fatigue, and made her only fearful
## 11056       of betraying herself to her sister.  Short was the time, however, in
## 11057            which that fear could affect her, for within half an hour after
## 11058    Willoughby&#39;s leaving the house, she was again called down stairs by the
## 11059            sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her mother from every
## 11060       unnecessary moment&#39;s horrible suspense, she ran immediately into the
## 11061     hall, and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support
## 11062                                                     her as she entered it.
## 11063                                                                           
## 11064       Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced
## 11065         almost the conviction of Marianne&#39;s being no more, had no voice to
## 11066      inquire after her, no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neither
## 11067     for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--and her
## 11068     mother, catching it with all her usual warmth, was in a moment as much
## 11069       overcome by her happiness, as she had been before by her fears.  She
## 11070           was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter and her
## 11071          friend;--and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable to
## 11072      speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at intervals
## 11073       to press Colonel Brandon&#39;s hand, with a look which spoke at once her
## 11074     gratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss
## 11075      of the moment.  He shared it, however, in a silence even greater than
## 11076                                                                   her own.
## 11077                                                                           
## 11078    As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was her
## 11079           first desire; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child,
## 11080      rendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger.
## 11081       Elinor&#39;s delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only
## 11082              checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther
## 11083       sleep;--but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when
## 11084       the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing
## 11085               her mother was near her, and conscious of being too weak for
## 11086     conversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by
## 11087    every nurse around her.  Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night;
## 11088    and Elinor, in compliance with her mother&#39;s entreaty, went to bed.  But
## 11089        the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the
## 11090             most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by
## 11091          irritation of spirits.  Willoughby, &quot;poor Willoughby,&quot; as she now
## 11092     allowed herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she would
## 11093      not but have heard his vindication for the world, and now blamed, now
## 11094        acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before.  But her
## 11095          promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful.  She
## 11096         dreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne
## 11097      might be; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be
## 11098          happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower.
## 11099      Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to HIS
## 11100      sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival&#39;s, the reward
## 11101               of her sister was due, and wished any thing rather than Mrs.
## 11102                                                        Willoughby&#39;s death.
## 11103                                                                           
## 11104     The shock of Colonel Brandon&#39;s errand at Barton had been much softened
## 11105           to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm; for so great was her
## 11106      uneasiness about Marianne, that she had already determined to set out
## 11107            for Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further
## 11108       intelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,
## 11109    that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away,
## 11110    as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection.
## 11111                                                                           
## 11112    Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness of
## 11113      Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s looks and spirits proved her to be, as she repeatedly
## 11114    declared herself, one of the happiest women in the world.  Elinor could
## 11115         not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes
## 11116            wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward.  But Mrs.
## 11117      Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment
## 11118    which Elinor had sent her, was led away by the exuberance of her joy to
## 11119        think only of what would increase it.  Marianne was restored to her
## 11120         from a danger in which, as she now began to feel, her own mistaken
## 11121      judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, had
## 11122         contributed to place her;--and in her recovery she had yet another
## 11123     source of joy unthought of by Elinor.  It was thus imparted to her, as
## 11124       soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred.
## 11125                                                                           
## 11126              &quot;At last we are alone.  My Elinor, you do not yet know all my
## 11127   happiness.  Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.  He has told me so himself.&quot;
## 11128                                                                           
## 11129      Her daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised and
## 11130                                   not surprised, was all silent attention.
## 11131                                                                           
## 11132            &quot;You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at your
## 11133         composure now.  Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my
## 11134    family, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon&#39;s marrying one of you as
## 11135        the object most desirable.  And I believe Marianne will be the most
## 11136                                                happy with him of the two.&quot;
## 11137                                                                           
## 11138        Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so, because
## 11139    satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age,
## 11140    characters, or feelings, could be given;--but her mother must always be
## 11141            carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject, and
## 11142           therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile.
## 11143                                                                           
## 11144       &quot;He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled.  It came
## 11145    out quite unawares, quite undesignedly.  I, you may well believe, could
## 11146    talk of nothing but my child;--he could not conceal his distress; I saw
## 11147    that it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship,
## 11148    as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy--or rather,
## 11149       not thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to irresistible feelings,
## 11150       made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant, affection for
## 11151     Marianne.  He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since the first moment of
## 11152                                                               seeing her.&quot;
## 11153                                                                           
## 11154    Here, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language, not the professions
## 11155         of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her mother&#39;s
## 11156   active fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose.
## 11157                                                                           
## 11158        &quot;His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby
## 11159                ever felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere or
## 11160      constant--which ever we are to call it--has subsisted through all the
## 11161      knowledge of dear Marianne&#39;s unhappy prepossession for that worthless
## 11162    young man!--and without selfishness--without encouraging a hope!--could
## 11163    he have seen her happy with another--Such a noble mind!--such openness,
## 11164                           such sincerity!--no one can be deceived in HIM.&quot;
## 11165                                                                           
## 11166       &quot;Colonel Brandon&#39;s character,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;as an excellent man, is
## 11167                                                         well established.&quot;
## 11168                                                                           
## 11169   &quot;I know it is,&quot;--replied her mother seriously, &quot;or after such a warning,
## 11170    I should be the last to encourage such affection, or even to be pleased
## 11171      by it.  But his coming for me as he did, with such active, such ready
## 11172           friendship, is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men.&quot;
## 11173                                                                           
## 11174    &quot;His character, however,&quot; answered Elinor, &quot;does not rest on ONE act of
## 11175    kindness, to which his affection for Marianne, were humanity out of the
## 11176    case, would have prompted him.  To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he
## 11177     has been long and intimately known; they equally love and respect him;
## 11178          and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired, is very
## 11179    considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him, that if Marianne
## 11180        can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as yourself to think our
## 11181      connection the greatest blessing to us in the world.  What answer did
## 11182                                 you give him?--Did you allow him to hope?&quot;
## 11183                                                                           
## 11184           &quot;Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself.
## 11185    Marianne might at that moment be dying.  But he did not ask for hope or
## 11186        encouragement.  His was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible
## 11187        effusion to a soothing friend--not an application to a parent.  Yet
## 11188     after a time I DID say, for at first I was quite overcome--that if she
## 11189          lived, as I trusted she might, my greatest happiness would lie in
## 11190      promoting their marriage; and since our arrival, since our delightful
## 11191       security, I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every
## 11192     encouragement in my power.  Time, a very little time, I tell him, will
## 11193    do everything;--Marianne&#39;s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a
## 11194                  man as Willoughby.-- His own merits must soon secure it.&quot;
## 11195                                                                           
## 11196       &quot;To judge from the Colonel&#39;s spirits, however, you have not yet made
## 11197                                                     him equally sanguine.&quot;
## 11198                                                                           
## 11199      &quot;No.--He thinks Marianne&#39;s affection too deeply rooted for any change
## 11200     in it under a great length of time, and even supposing her heart again
## 11201             free, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such a
## 11202        difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her.  There,
## 11203     however, he is quite mistaken.  His age is only so much beyond hers as
## 11204    to be an advantage, as to make his character and principles fixed;--and
## 11205      his disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very one to make
## 11206        your sister happy.  And his person, his manners too, are all in his
## 11207           favour.  My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not so
## 11208      handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time, there is something much
## 11209      more pleasing in his countenance.-- There was always a something,--if
## 11210       you remember,--in Willoughby&#39;s eyes at times, which I did not like.&quot;
## 11211                                                                           
## 11212     Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother, without waiting for her
## 11213                                                         assent, continued,
## 11214                                                                           
## 11215      &quot;And his manners, the Colonel&#39;s manners are not only more pleasing to
## 11216      me than Willoughby&#39;s ever were, but they are of a kind I well know to
## 11217    be more solidly attaching to Marianne.  Their gentleness, their genuine
## 11218    attention to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity is much
## 11219       more accordant with her real disposition, than the liveliness--often
## 11220      artificial, and often ill-timed of the other.  I am very sure myself,
## 11221         that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as he has proved
## 11222     himself the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy with
## 11223                                 HIM, as she will be with Colonel Brandon.&quot;
## 11224                                                                           
## 11225          She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree with her, but her
## 11226                      dissent was not heard, and therefore gave no offence.
## 11227                                                                           
## 11228       &quot;At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me,&quot; added Mrs.
## 11229      Dashwood, &quot;even if I remain at Barton; and in all probability,--for I
## 11230     hear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly MUST be some small
## 11231         house or cottage close by, that would suit us quite as well as our
## 11232                                                        present situation.&quot;
## 11233                                                                           
## 11234      Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!--but
## 11235                                                   her spirit was stubborn.
## 11236                                                                           
## 11237        &quot;His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know, everybody cares
## 11238         about THAT;--and though I neither know nor desire to know, what it
## 11239                               really is, I am sure it must be a good one.&quot;
## 11240                                                                           
## 11241          Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person, and
## 11242    Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to her
## 11243              friend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.
## 11244                                                                           
## 11245                                                                           
## 11246                                                                           
## 11247                                                                 CHAPTER 46
## 11248                                                                           
## 11249                                                                           
## 11250        Marianne&#39;s illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been long
## 11251    enough to make her recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength, and
## 11252    her mother&#39;s presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her
## 11253     to remove, within four days after the arrival of the latter, into Mrs.
## 11254    Palmer&#39;s dressing-room.  When there, at her own particular request, for
## 11255         she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her
## 11256                          mother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her.
## 11257                                                                           
## 11258      His emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and in
## 11259         receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him, was
## 11260      such, as, in Elinor&#39;s conjecture, must arise from something more than
## 11261     his affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to
## 11262          others; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying
## 11263     complexion as he looked at her sister, the probable recurrence of many
## 11264        past scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblance
## 11265      between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened
## 11266     by the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,
## 11267                        and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.
## 11268                                                                           
## 11269     Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than her daughter, but
## 11270    with a mind very differently influenced, and therefore watching to very
## 11271    different effect, saw nothing in the Colonel&#39;s behaviour but what arose
## 11272     from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in the actions
## 11273        and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something
## 11274                                        more than gratitude already dawned.
## 11275                                                                           
## 11276        At the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly stronger
## 11277        every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her own and her
## 11278            daughter&#39;s wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton.  On HER
## 11279        measures depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could not
## 11280    quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods&#39; stay; and Colonel Brandon was soon
## 11281       brought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there as
## 11282        equally determinate, if not equally indispensable.  At his and Mrs.
## 11283     Jennings&#39;s united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to
## 11284         accept the use of his carriage on her journey back, for the better
## 11285             accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel, at the joint
## 11286    invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active good-nature
## 11287      made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself,
## 11288       engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the
## 11289                                                     course of a few weeks.
## 11290                                                                           
## 11291    The day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after taking
## 11292    so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly
## 11293      grateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own
## 11294        heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding
## 11295      Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefully
## 11296     assisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed anxious that she
## 11297     should engross at least half.  Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed,
## 11298     and the others were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers, and
## 11299     feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise
## 11300    to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young
## 11301            companions; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his
## 11302                                                  solitary way to Delaford.
## 11303                                                                           
## 11304     The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journey
## 11305     on both, without essential fatigue.  Every thing that the most zealous
## 11306    affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable,
## 11307     was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward
## 11308           in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits.  To Elinor, the
## 11309    observation of the latter was particularly grateful.  She, who had seen
## 11310       her week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of
## 11311          heart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude to
## 11312        conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, an
## 11313      apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she trusted
## 11314         of serious reflection, must eventually lead her to contentment and
## 11315                                                              cheerfulness.
## 11316                                                                           
## 11317    As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which every
## 11318     field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection,
## 11319       she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their
## 11320         notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window.  But here, Elinor
## 11321          could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she assisted
## 11322      Marianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw only an
## 11323    emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,
## 11324        and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.  In the whole of her
## 11325          subsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened to
## 11326           reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common
## 11327       sitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of
## 11328     resolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the
## 11329    sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be
## 11330     connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness,
## 11331      and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away without
## 11332     the atonement of a smile.  After dinner she would try her piano-forte.
## 11333         She went to it; but the music on which her eye first rested was an
## 11334            opera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their
## 11335       favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his
## 11336       hand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head, put the music
## 11337         aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained of
## 11338      feebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaring
## 11339    however with firmness as she did so, that she should in future practice
## 11340                                                                      much.
## 11341                                                                           
## 11342    The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms.  On the
## 11343      contrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked
## 11344           and spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of
## 11345        Margaret&#39;s return, and talking of the dear family party which would
## 11346    then be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as the
## 11347                                               only happiness worth a wish.
## 11348                                                                           
## 11349      &quot;When the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength,&quot; said
## 11350     she, &quot;we will take long walks together every day.  We will walk to the
## 11351      farm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will
## 11352     walk to Sir John&#39;s new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;
## 11353  and we will often go to the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its
## 11354      foundations as far as we are told they once reached.  I know we shall
## 11355      be happy.  I know the summer will pass happily away.  I mean never to
## 11356        be later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall
## 11357     divide every moment between music and reading.  I have formed my plan,
## 11358          and am determined to enter on a course of serious study.  Our own
## 11359    library is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing beyond
## 11360        mere amusement.  But there are many works well worth reading at the
## 11361    Park; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can
## 11362       borrow of Colonel Brandon.  By reading only six hours a-day, I shall
## 11363     gain in the course of a twelve-month a great deal of instruction which
## 11364                                                I now feel myself to want.&quot;
## 11365                                                                           
## 11366          Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this;
## 11367      though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her
## 11368      to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work
## 11369        in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and
## 11370        virtuous self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she
## 11371      remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared
## 11372         she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of
## 11373          Marianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy
## 11374      tranquillity.  Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved
## 11375    to wait till her sister&#39;s health were more secure, before she appointed
## 11376                        it.  But the resolution was made only to be broken.
## 11377                                                                           
## 11378        Marianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was
## 11379     fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out.  But at last a
## 11380          soft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter&#39;s
## 11381      wishes and the mother&#39;s confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor&#39;s
## 11382       arm, was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue, in
## 11383                                                 the lane before the house.
## 11384                                                                           
## 11385    The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an
## 11386        exercise hitherto untried since her illness required;--and they had
## 11387       advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the
## 11388         hill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes turned
## 11389                                          towards it, Marianne calmly said,
## 11390                                                                           
## 11391       &quot;There, exactly there,&quot;--pointing with one hand, &quot;on that projecting
## 11392                   mound,--there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby.&quot;
## 11393                                                                           
## 11394            Her voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,
## 11395                                                                           
## 11396          &quot;I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the
## 11397       spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?&quot;--hesitatingly it
## 11398       was said.--&quot;Or will it be wrong?--I can talk of it now, I hope, as I
## 11399                                                            ought to do.&quot;--
## 11400                                                                           
## 11401                                    Elinor tenderly invited her to be open.
## 11402                                                                           
## 11403    &quot;As for regret,&quot; said Marianne, &quot;I have done with that, as far as HE is
## 11404     concerned.  I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been
## 11405    for him, but what they are NOW.--At present, if I could be satisfied on
## 11406    one point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS acting
## 11407     a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all, if I could be assured
## 11408        that he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied
## 11409                           him, since the story of that unfortunate girl&quot;--
## 11410                                                                           
## 11411           She stopt.  Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered,
## 11412                                                                           
## 11413           &quot;If you could be assured of that, you think you should be easy.&quot;
## 11414                                                                           
## 11415       &quot;Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;--for not only is it
## 11416      horrible to suspect a person, who has been what HE has been to ME, of
## 11417       such designs,--but what must it make me appear to myself?--What in a
## 11418       situation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could
## 11419                                                            expose me to&quot;--
## 11420                                                                           
## 11421       &quot;How then,&quot; asked her sister, &quot;would you account for his behaviour?&quot;
## 11422                                                                           
## 11423    &quot;I would suppose him,--Oh, how gladly would I suppose him, only fickle,
## 11424                                                        very, very fickle.&quot;
## 11425                                                                           
## 11426               Elinor said no more.  She was debating within herself on the
## 11427         eligibility of beginning her story directly, or postponing it till
## 11428     Marianne were in stronger health;--and they crept on for a few minutes
## 11429                                                                in silence.
## 11430                                                                           
## 11431         &quot;I am not wishing him too much good,&quot; said Marianne at last with a
## 11432        sigh, &quot;when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant
## 11433                              than my own.  He will suffer enough in them.&quot;
## 11434                                                                           
## 11435                                    &quot;Do you compare your conduct with his?&quot;
## 11436                                                                           
## 11437       &quot;No. I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it with
## 11438                                                                    yours.&quot;
## 11439                                                                           
## 11440                            &quot;Our situations have borne little resemblance.&quot;
## 11441                                                                           
## 11442    &quot;They have borne more than our conduct.--Do not, my dearest Elinor, let
## 11443           your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure.  My
## 11444       illness has made me think-- It has given me leisure and calmness for
## 11445       serious recollection.  Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I
## 11446     was perfectly able to reflect.  I considered the past: I saw in my own
## 11447           behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last
## 11448     autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of
## 11449            kindness to others.  I saw that my own feelings had prepared my
## 11450     sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me
## 11451    to the grave.  My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by
## 11452      myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the
## 11453     time to be wrong.  Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I
## 11454          did not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such
## 11455    feelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,--wonder
## 11456             that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for
## 11457       atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once.  Had I
## 11458        died,--in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my
## 11459    friend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my
## 11460     latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!--How should
## 11461       I have lived in YOUR remembrance!--My mother too! How could you have
## 11462     consoled her!--I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.  Whenever
## 11463      I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing
## 11464             indulged.  Every body seemed injured by me.  The kindness, the
## 11465          unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful
## 11466        contempt.  To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every
## 11467     common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart
## 11468        hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very
## 11469          attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them, little as they
## 11470        deserve, I had given less than their due.  But you,--you above all,
## 11471         above my mother, had been wronged by me.  I, and only I, knew your
## 11472        heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any
## 11473      compassion that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was before
## 11474    me; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate of you and your comfort?
## 11475       Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking
## 11476            any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular
## 11477                    gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge
## 11478       alone?--No;--not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had
## 11479       believed you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or
## 11480      friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting
## 11481    only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for
## 11482     whom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake.&quot;
## 11483                                                                           
## 11484       Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor,
## 11485      impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly
## 11486     that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well
## 11487                          deserved.  Marianne pressed her hand and replied,
## 11488                                                                           
## 11489     &quot;You are very good.--The future must be my proof.  I have laid down my
## 11490          plan, and if I am capable of adhering to it--my feelings shall be
## 11491       governed and my temper improved.  They shall no longer worry others,
## 11492       nor torture myself.  I shall now live solely for my family.  You, my
## 11493     mother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you will
## 11494       share my affections entirely between you.  From you, from my home, I
## 11495    shall never again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do mix
## 11496    in other society, it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled, my
## 11497          heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the lesser
## 11498    duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance.  As for Willoughby--to
## 11499      say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him, would be idle.
## 11500           His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or
## 11501     opinions.  But it shall be regulated, it shall be checked by religion,
## 11502                                        by reason, by constant employment.&quot;
## 11503                                                                           
## 11504      She paused--and added in a low voice, &quot;If I could but know HIS heart,
## 11505                                             everything would become easy.&quot;
## 11506                                                                           
## 11507      Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or
## 11508    impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at all
## 11509          nearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as
## 11510         reflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself
## 11511                                                       leading to the fact.
## 11512                                                                           
## 11513          She managed the recital, as she hoped, with address; prepared her
## 11514       anxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chief
## 11515        points on which Willoughby grounded his apology; did justice to his
## 11516         repentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard.
## 11517        Marianne said not a word.--She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the
## 11518    ground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them.  A
## 11519        thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge
## 11520          one.  She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,
## 11521    unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister&#39;s, and tears covered
## 11522                                                                her cheeks.
## 11523                                                                           
## 11524      Elinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home; and till they
## 11525    reached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her curiosity
## 11526     must be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of nothing
## 11527         but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was carefully
## 11528      minute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could
## 11529    be safely indulged.  As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a
## 11530          kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her
## 11531          tears, &quot;Tell mama,&quot; withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up
## 11532      stairs.  Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable
## 11533        as what she now sought; and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its
## 11534    result, and a resolution of reviving the subject again, should Marianne
## 11535          fail to do it, she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting
## 11536                                                                injunction.
## 11537                                                                           
## 11538                                                                           
## 11539                                                                           
## 11540                                                                 CHAPTER 47
## 11541                                                                           
## 11542                                                                           
## 11543           Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former
## 11544        favourite.  She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his
## 11545     imputed guilt;--she was sorry for him;--she wished him happy.  But the
## 11546     feelings of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore him
## 11547      with a faith unbroken--a character unblemished, to Marianne.  Nothing
## 11548    could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his
## 11549         means, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza.  Nothing
## 11550         could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure the
## 11551                                              interests of Colonel Brandon.
## 11552                                                                           
## 11553        Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby&#39;s story from
## 11554      himself--had she witnessed his distress, and been under the influence
## 11555      of his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassion
## 11556     would have been greater.  But it was neither in Elinor&#39;s power, nor in
## 11557               her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailed
## 11558     explanation, as had at first been called forth in herself.  Reflection
## 11559         had given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion of
## 11560          Willoughby&#39;s deserts;--she wished, therefore, to declare only the
## 11561            simple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his
## 11562       character, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy
## 11563                                                                    astray.
## 11564                                                                           
## 11565          In the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began
## 11566         voluntarily to speak of him again;--but that it was not without an
## 11567     effort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for
## 11568    some time previously sitting--her rising colour, as she spoke,--and her
## 11569                                            unsteady voice, plainly shewed.
## 11570                                                                           
## 11571     &quot;I wish to assure you both,&quot; said she, &quot;that I see every thing--as you
## 11572                                                      can desire me to do.&quot;
## 11573                                                                           
## 11574           Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing
## 11575         tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her sister&#39;s
## 11576         unbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her silence.  Marianne
## 11577                                                         slowly continued--
## 11578                                                                           
## 11579      &quot;It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told me this morning--I have
## 11580      now heard exactly what I wished to hear.&quot;--For some moments her voice
## 11581     was lost; but recovering herself, she added, and with greater calmness
## 11582       than before--&quot;I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change.  I
## 11583    never could have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or later
## 11584          I must have known, all this.--I should have had no confidence, no
## 11585                  esteem.  Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.&quot;
## 11586                                                                           
## 11587            &quot;I know it--I know it,&quot; cried her mother.  &quot;Happy with a man of
## 11588     libertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest
## 11589      of our friends, and the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heart
## 11590           to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her sensitive
## 11591         conscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her husband
## 11592                                                       ought to have felt.&quot;
## 11593                                                                           
## 11594                     Marianne sighed, and repeated, &quot;I wish for no change.&quot;
## 11595                                                                           
## 11596      &quot;You consider the matter,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;exactly as a good mind and a
## 11597      sound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as
## 11598         well as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,
## 11599    reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you
## 11600      in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would have
## 11601     been poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less certain.
## 11602     Had you married, you must have been always poor.  His expensiveness is
## 11603          acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares that
## 11604      self-denial is a word hardly understood by him.  His demands and your
## 11605    inexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought
## 11606     on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you, from having
## 11607       been entirely unknown and unthought of before.  YOUR sense of honour
## 11608      and honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation,
## 11609         to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and,
## 11610    perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,
## 11611      you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--and how
## 11612      little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin
## 11613               which had begun before your marriage?-- Beyond THAT, had you
## 11614      endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not
## 11615         to be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to
## 11616    consent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his heart,
## 11617          and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such
## 11618                                                             difficulties?&quot;
## 11619                                                                           
## 11620        Marianne&#39;s lips quivered, and she repeated the word &quot;Selfish?&quot; in a
## 11621                      tone that implied--&quot;do you really think him selfish?&quot;
## 11622                                                                           
## 11623       &quot;The whole of his behaviour,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;from the beginning to
## 11624           the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness.  It was
## 11625         selfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which
## 11626    afterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession of
## 11627      it, and which finally carried him from Barton.  His own enjoyment, or
## 11628             his own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle.&quot;
## 11629                                                                           
## 11630                     &quot;It is very true.  MY happiness never was his object.&quot;
## 11631                                                                           
## 11632     &quot;At present,&quot; continued Elinor, &quot;he regrets what he has done.  And why
## 11633           does he regret it?--Because he finds it has not answered towards
## 11634            himself.  It has not made him happy.  His circumstances are now
## 11635    unembarrassed--he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only
## 11636        that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself.
## 11637             But does it follow that had he married you, he would have been
## 11638       happy?--The inconveniences would have been different.  He would then
## 11639       have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they are
## 11640     removed, he now reckons as nothing.  He would have had a wife of whose
## 11641           temper he could make no complaint, but he would have been always
## 11642     necessitous--always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank
## 11643       the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far
## 11644     more importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a
## 11645                                                                     wife.&quot;
## 11646                                                                           
## 11647          &quot;I have not a doubt of it,&quot; said Marianne; &quot;and I have nothing to
## 11648                                         regret--nothing but my own folly.&quot;
## 11649                                                                           
## 11650       &quot;Rather say your mother&#39;s imprudence, my child,&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood;
## 11651                                                  &quot;SHE must be answerable.&quot;
## 11652                                                                           
## 11653       Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor, satisfied that each
## 11654    felt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that might
## 11655            weaken her sister&#39;s spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first
## 11656                                            subject, immediately continued,
## 11657                                                                           
## 11658       &quot;One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the
## 11659       story--that all Willoughby&#39;s difficulties have arisen from the first
## 11660    offence against virtue, in his behaviour to Eliza Williams.  That crime
## 11661            has been the origin of every lesser one, and of all his present
## 11662                                                              discontents.&quot;
## 11663                                                                           
## 11664     Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark; and her mother was led
## 11665     by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon&#39;s injuries and merits, warm
## 11666     as friendship and design could unitedly dictate.  Her daughter did not
## 11667                         look, however, as if much of it were heard by her.
## 11668                                                                           
## 11669    Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two or three following
## 11670     days, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done;
## 11671      but while her resolution was unsubdued, and she still tried to appear
## 11672     cheerful and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect of time
## 11673                                                           upon her health.
## 11674                                                                           
## 11675          Margaret returned, and the family were again all restored to each
## 11676     other, again quietly settled at the cottage; and if not pursuing their
## 11677         usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to
## 11678        Barton, at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.
## 11679                                                                           
## 11680           Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward.  She had heard
## 11681         nothing of him since her leaving London, nothing new of his plans,
## 11682        nothing certain even of his present abode.  Some letters had passed
## 11683     between her and her brother, in consequence of Marianne&#39;s illness; and
## 11684           in the first of John&#39;s, there had been this sentence:-- &quot;We know
## 11685         nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so
## 11686       prohibited a subject, but conclude him to be still at Oxford;&quot; which
## 11687     was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence,
## 11688      for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.
## 11689      She was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his measures.
## 11690                                                                           
## 11691     Their man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; and
## 11692         when, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of his
## 11693             mistress as to the event of his errand, this was his voluntary
## 11694                                                            communication--
## 11695                                                                           
## 11696                  &quot;I suppose you know, ma&#39;am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.&quot;
## 11697                                                                           
## 11698         Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw her
## 11699     turning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics.  Mrs. Dashwood,
## 11700         whose eyes, as she answered the servant&#39;s inquiry, had intuitively
## 11701              taken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor&#39;s
## 11702         countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment afterwards,
## 11703       alike distressed by Marianne&#39;s situation, knew not on which child to
## 11704                                            bestow her principal attention.
## 11705                                                                           
## 11706      The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense
## 11707     enough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s assistance,
## 11708      supported her into the other room.  By that time, Marianne was rather
## 11709         better, and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the
## 11710    maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so far
## 11711       recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an
## 11712    inquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his intelligence.  Mrs. Dashwood
## 11713           immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor had the
## 11714             benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.
## 11715                                                                           
## 11716                       &quot;Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?&quot;
## 11717                                                                           
## 11718     &quot;I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma&#39;am, this morning in Exeter, and his lady
## 11719     too, Miss Steele as was.  They was stopping in a chaise at the door of
## 11720       the New London Inn, as I went there with a message from Sally at the
## 11721    Park to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened to look up
## 11722    as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss
## 11723        Steele; so I took off my hat, and she knew me and called to me, and
## 11724           inquired after you, ma&#39;am, and the young ladies, especially Miss
## 11725      Marianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars&#39;s,
## 11726    their best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had not
## 11727           time to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go
## 11728          forwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but
## 11729      howsever, when they come back, they&#39;d make sure to come and see you.&quot;
## 11730                                                                           
## 11731                            &quot;But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?&quot;
## 11732                                                                           
## 11733       &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am. She smiled, and said how she had changed her name since
## 11734     she was in these parts.  She was always a very affable and free-spoken
## 11735     young lady, and very civil behaved.  So, I made free to wish her joy.&quot;
## 11736                                                                           
## 11737                                &quot;Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?&quot;
## 11738                                                                           
## 11739        &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am, I just see him leaning back in it, but he did not look
## 11740                           up;--he never was a gentleman much for talking.&quot;
## 11741                                                                           
## 11742            Elinor&#39;s heart could easily account for his not putting himself
## 11743            forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.
## 11744                                                                           
## 11745                                   &quot;Was there no one else in the carriage?&quot;
## 11746                                                                           
## 11747                                                &quot;No, ma&#39;am, only they two.&quot;
## 11748                                                                           
## 11749                                        &quot;Do you know where they came from?&quot;
## 11750                                                                           
## 11751        &quot;They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--Mrs. Ferrars told me.&quot;
## 11752                                                                           
## 11753                                     &quot;And are they going farther westward?&quot;
## 11754                                                                           
## 11755      &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am--but not to bide long.  They will soon be back again, and
## 11756                                        then they&#39;d be sure and call here.&quot;
## 11757                                                                           
## 11758      Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter; but Elinor knew better than
## 11759      to expect them.  She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and
## 11760            was very confident that Edward would never come near them.  She
## 11761      observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they were probably going
## 11762                                        down to Mr. Pratt&#39;s, near Plymouth.
## 11763                                                                           
## 11764      Thomas&#39;s intelligence seemed over.  Elinor looked as if she wished to
## 11765                                                                 hear more.
## 11766                                                                           
## 11767                              &quot;Did you see them off, before you came away?&quot;
## 11768                                                                           
## 11769      &quot;No, ma&#39;am--the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any
## 11770                                       longer; I was afraid of being late.&quot;
## 11771                                                                           
## 11772                                              &quot;Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?&quot;
## 11773                                                                           
## 11774        &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am, she said how she was very well; and to my mind she was
## 11775       always a very handsome young lady--and she seemed vastly contented.&quot;
## 11776                                                                           
## 11777         Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the
## 11778            tablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed.
## 11779        Marianne had already sent to say, that she should eat nothing more.
## 11780     Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s and Elinor&#39;s appetites were equally lost, and Margaret
## 11781    might think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as both
## 11782       her sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had often
## 11783        had to be careless of their meals, she had never been obliged to go
## 11784                                                 without her dinner before.
## 11785                                                                           
## 11786         When the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and
## 11787           Elinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a
## 11788         similarity of thoughtfulness and silence.  Mrs. Dashwood feared to
## 11789         hazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation.  She now
## 11790          found that she had erred in relying on Elinor&#39;s representation of
## 11791          herself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly
## 11792        softened at the time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness,
## 11793       suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne.  She found that she
## 11794           had been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of her
## 11795              daughter, to think the attachment, which once she had so well
## 11796            understood, much slighter in reality, than she had been wont to
## 11797      believe, or than it was now proved to be.  She feared that under this
## 11798    persuasion she had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her
## 11799       Elinor;--that Marianne&#39;s affliction, because more acknowledged, more
## 11800     immediately before her, had too much engrossed her tenderness, and led
## 11801      her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering
## 11802          almost as much, certainly with less self-provocation, and greater
## 11803                                                                 fortitude.
## 11804                                                                           
## 11805                                                                           
## 11806                                                                           
## 11807                                                                 CHAPTER 48
## 11808                                                                           
## 11809                                                                           
## 11810              Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an
## 11811     unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it,
## 11812    and certainty itself.  She now found, that in spite of herself, she had
## 11813       always admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something
## 11814      would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of his
## 11815       own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of
## 11816    establishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of all.
## 11817        But he was now married; and she condemned her heart for the lurking
## 11818           flattery, which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.
## 11819                                                                           
## 11820    That he should be married soon, before (as she imagined) he could be in
## 11821           orders, and consequently before he could be in possession of the
## 11822      living, surprised her a little at first.  But she soon saw how likely
## 11823       it was that Lucy, in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure
## 11824         him, should overlook every thing but the risk of delay.  They were
## 11825     married, married in town, and now hastening down to her uncle&#39;s.  What
## 11826      had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing her
## 11827                               mother&#39;s servant, on hearing Lucy&#39;s message!
## 11828                                                                           
## 11829    They would soon, she supposed, be settled at Delaford.--Delaford,--that
## 11830        place in which so much conspired to give her an interest; which she
## 11831      wished to be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid.  She saw them
## 11832           in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw in Lucy, the active,
## 11833      contriving manager, uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with
## 11834              the utmost frugality, and ashamed to be suspected of half her
## 11835         economical practices;--pursuing her own interest in every thought,
## 11836     courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every
## 11837        wealthy friend.  In Edward--she knew not what she saw, nor what she
## 11838    wished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing pleased her; she turned away
## 11839                                         her head from every sketch of him.
## 11840                                                                           
## 11841      Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London
## 11842                would write to them to announce the event, and give farther
## 11843      particulars,--but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no
## 11844     tidings.  Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found fault
## 11845          with every absent friend.  They were all thoughtless or indolent.
## 11846                                                                           
## 11847        &quot;When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma&#39;am?&quot; was an inquiry which
## 11848         sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on.
## 11849                                                                           
## 11850     &quot;I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to
## 11851     hear from him again.  I earnestly pressed his coming to us, and should
## 11852        not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.&quot;
## 11853                                                                           
## 11854         This was gaining something, something to look forward to.  Colonel
## 11855                                Brandon must have some information to give.
## 11856                                                                           
## 11857             Scarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man on
## 11858    horseback drew her eyes to the window.  He stopt at their gate.  It was
## 11859     a gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself.  Now she could hear more;
## 11860            and she trembled in expectation of it.  But--it was NOT Colonel
## 11861      Brandon--neither his air--nor his height.  Were it possible, she must
## 11862    say it must be Edward.  She looked again.  He had just dismounted;--she
## 11863       could not be mistaken,--it WAS Edward.  She moved away and sat down.
## 11864    &quot;He comes from Mr. Pratt&#39;s purposely to see us.  I WILL be calm; I WILL
## 11865                                                    be mistress of myself.&quot;
## 11866                                                                           
## 11867       In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the
## 11868     mistake.  She saw her mother and Marianne change colour; saw them look
## 11869     at herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other.  She would have
## 11870      given the world to be able to speak--and to make them understand that
## 11871       she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear in their behaviour to
## 11872      him;--but she had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to their
## 11873                                                            own discretion.
## 11874                                                                           
## 11875           Not a syllable passed aloud.  They all waited in silence for the
## 11876    appearance of their visitor.  His footsteps were heard along the gravel
## 11877      path; in a moment he was in the passage, and in another he was before
## 11878                                                                      them.
## 11879                                                                           
## 11880       His countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even for
## 11881      Elinor.  His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as if
## 11882       fearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.
## 11883       Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted, to the wishes of
## 11884     that daughter, by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be
## 11885     guided in every thing, met with a look of forced complacency, gave him
## 11886                                              her hand, and wished him joy.
## 11887                                                                           
## 11888     He coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply.  Elinor&#39;s lips
## 11889      had moved with her mother&#39;s, and, when the moment of action was over,
## 11890    she wished that she had shaken hands with him too.  But it was then too
## 11891    late, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again and
## 11892                                                     talked of the weather.
## 11893                                                                           
## 11894    Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal her
## 11895      distress; and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole of
## 11896       the case, thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore
## 11897          took a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained a strict
## 11898                                                                   silence.
## 11899                                                                           
## 11900     When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very
## 11901        awful pause took place.  It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who
## 11902        felt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well.  In a
## 11903                             hurried manner, he replied in the affirmative.
## 11904                                                                           
## 11905                                                             Another pause.
## 11906                                                                           
## 11907     Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her own
## 11908                                                           voice, now said,
## 11909                                                                           
## 11910                                           &quot;Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?&quot;
## 11911                                                                           
## 11912     &quot;At Longstaple!&quot; he replied, with an air of surprise.-- &quot;No, my mother
## 11913                                                               is in town.&quot;
## 11914                                                                           
## 11915    &quot;I meant,&quot; said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, &quot;to inquire
## 11916                                                  for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars.&quot;
## 11917                                                                           
## 11918      She dared not look up;--but her mother and Marianne both turned their
## 11919       eyes on him.  He coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and,
## 11920                                             after some hesitation, said,--
## 11921                                                                           
## 11922        &quot;Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs. ROBERT Ferrars.&quot;
## 11923                                                                           
## 11924      &quot;Mrs. Robert Ferrars!&quot;--was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an
## 11925        accent of the utmost amazement;--and though Elinor could not speak,
## 11926        even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder.  He
## 11927          rose from his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not
## 11928         knowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and
## 11929         while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to
## 11930                              pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,
## 11931                                                                           
## 11932        &quot;Perhaps you do not know--you may not have heard that my brother is
## 11933                  lately married to--to the youngest--to Miss Lucy Steele.&quot;
## 11934                                                                           
## 11935     His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor,
## 11936            who sat with her head leaning over her work, in a state of such
## 11937                           agitation as made her hardly know where she was.
## 11938                                                                           
## 11939     &quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish.&quot;
## 11940                                                                           
## 11941     Elinor could sit it no longer.  She almost ran out of the room, and as
## 11942       soon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first
## 11943       she thought would never cease.  Edward, who had till then looked any
## 11944    where, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw--or even
## 11945     heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie,
## 11946            which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of Mrs.
## 11947      Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word, quitted
## 11948    the room, and walked out towards the village--leaving the others in the
## 11949      greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation, so
## 11950          wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity which they had no means of
## 11951                                    lessening but by their own conjectures.
## 11952                                                                           
## 11953                                                                           
## 11954                                                                           
## 11955                                                                 CHAPTER 49
## 11956                                                                           
## 11957                                                                           
## 11958          Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his release might
## 11959    appear to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was free; and to
## 11960      what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre-determined
## 11961             by all;--for after experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent
## 11962     engagement, contracted without his mother&#39;s consent, as he had already
## 11963    done for more than four years, nothing less could be expected of him in
## 11964            the failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction of another.
## 11965                                                                           
## 11966       His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one.  It was only to ask
## 11967           Elinor to marry him;--and considering that he was not altogether
## 11968       inexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should
## 11969     feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in
## 11970                                       need of encouragement and fresh air.
## 11971                                                                           
## 11972    How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however, how
## 11973           soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he
## 11974       expressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularly
## 11975    told.  This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to table at
## 11976      four o&#39;clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his
## 11977      lady, engaged her mother&#39;s consent, and was not only in the rapturous
## 11978      profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one
## 11979       of the happiest of men.  His situation indeed was more than commonly
## 11980         joyful.  He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to
## 11981       swell his heart, and raise his spirits.  He was released without any
## 11982        reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his
## 11983     misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;--and elevated at
## 11984          once to that security with another, which he must have thought of
## 11985          almost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with
## 11986    desire.  He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to
## 11987            happiness;--and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine,
## 11988      flowing, grateful cheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in
## 11989                                                                him before.
## 11990                                                                           
## 11991       His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors
## 11992    confessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the
## 11993                                        philosophic dignity of twenty-four.
## 11994                                                                           
## 11995             &quot;It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,&quot; said he, &quot;the
## 11996     consequence of ignorance of the world--and want of employment.  Had my
## 11997      mother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen
## 11998        from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think--nay, I am sure, it would never
## 11999    have happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the
## 12000    time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had
## 12001        any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance
## 12002    from her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied
## 12003    attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I
## 12004         must have done.  But instead of having any thing to do, instead of
## 12005         having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any
## 12006           myself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first
## 12007        twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which
## 12008     belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not entered
## 12009    at Oxford till I was nineteen.  I had therefore nothing in the world to
## 12010     do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home
## 12011       in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my
## 12012     brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to
## 12013       be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and
## 12014    was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part
## 12015       of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything
## 12016     that was amiable and obliging.  She was pretty too--at least I thought
## 12017     so THEN; and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make no
## 12018     comparisons, and see no defects.  Considering everything, therefore, I
## 12019      hope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since in every
## 12020     way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable
## 12021                                                           piece of folly.&quot;
## 12022                                                                           
## 12023    The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness
## 12024            of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as promised them all, the
## 12025         satisfaction of a sleepless night.  Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be
## 12026    comfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how
## 12027       to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy,
## 12028         nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation
## 12029     together, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and society of both.
## 12030                                                                           
## 12031       Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears.  Comparisons would
## 12032       occur--regrets would arise;--and her joy, though sincere as her love
## 12033    for her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language.
## 12034                                                                           
## 12035      But Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of
## 12036    learning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to the
## 12037    moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed, she
## 12038     was every thing by turns but tranquil.  But when the second moment had
## 12039     passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude removed, compared
## 12040         her situation with what so lately it had been,--saw him honourably
## 12041    released from his former engagement, saw him instantly profiting by the
## 12042         release, to address herself and declare an affection as tender, as
## 12043    constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she was oppressed, she was
## 12044        overcome by her own felicity;--and happily disposed as is the human
## 12045          mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better, it
## 12046    required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any degree
## 12047                                              of tranquillity to her heart.
## 12048                                                                           
## 12049     Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever
## 12050      other claims might be made on him, it was impossible that less than a
## 12051           week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor&#39;s company, or
## 12052      suffice to say half that was to be said of the past, the present, and
## 12053        the future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of
## 12054        incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in
## 12055           common between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is
## 12056       different.  Between THEM no subject is finished, no communication is
## 12057               even made, till it has been made at least twenty times over.
## 12058                                                                           
## 12059       Lucy&#39;s marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all,
## 12060       formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and
## 12061       Elinor&#39;s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in
## 12062             every view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable
## 12063      circumstances she had ever heard.  How they could be thrown together,
## 12064        and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of
## 12065    whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,--a
## 12066         girl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose account that
## 12067               brother had been thrown off by his family--it was beyond her
## 12068           comprehension to make out.  To her own heart it was a delightful
## 12069        affair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her
## 12070                          reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.
## 12071                                                                           
## 12072      Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps,
## 12073    at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so worked
## 12074    on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.
## 12075        Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street, of his
## 12076      opinion of what his own mediation in his brother&#39;s affairs might have
## 12077                   done, if applied to in time.  She repeated it to Edward.
## 12078                                                                           
## 12079      &quot;THAT was exactly like Robert,&quot;--was his immediate observation.--&quot;And
## 12080          THAT,&quot; he presently added, &quot;might perhaps be in HIS head when the
## 12081    acquaintance between them first began.  And Lucy perhaps at first might
## 12082      think only of procuring his good offices in my favour.  Other designs
## 12083                                                    might afterward arise.&quot;
## 12084                                                                           
## 12085     How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally
## 12086            at a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had
## 12087    remained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no means
## 12088       of hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very last
## 12089     were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual.  Not the
## 12090        smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him for
## 12091     what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy
## 12092    herself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified between
## 12093     the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance.  He put the
## 12094                                                letter into Elinor&#39;s hands.
## 12095                                                                           
## 12096                                                                 &quot;DEAR SIR,
## 12097                                                                           
## 12098                         &quot;Being very sure I have long lost your affections,
## 12099                          I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own
## 12100                       on another, and have no doubt of being as happy with
## 12101                           him as I once used to think I might be with you;
## 12102                           but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was
## 12103                       another&#39;s.  Sincerely wish you happy in your choice,
## 12104                          and it shall not be my fault if we are not always
## 12105                           good friends, as our near relationship now makes
## 12106                           proper.  I can safely say I owe you no ill-will,
## 12107                          and am sure you will be too generous to do us any
## 12108                        ill offices.  Your brother has gained my affections
## 12109                             entirely, and as we could not live without one
## 12110                          another, we are just returned from the altar, and
## 12111                       are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks, which
## 12112                        place your dear brother has great curiosity to see,
## 12113                           but thought I would first trouble you with these
## 12114                                        few lines, and shall always remain,
## 12115                                                                           
## 12116                             &quot;Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister,
## 12117                                                             &quot;LUCY FERRARS.
## 12118                                                                           
## 12119                            &quot;I have burnt all your letters, and will return
## 12120                     your picture the first opportunity.  Please to destroy
## 12121                         my scrawls--but the ring with my hair you are very
## 12122                                                          welcome to keep.&quot;
## 12123                                                                           
## 12124                           Elinor read and returned it without any comment.
## 12125                                                                           
## 12126                 &quot;I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,&quot; said
## 12127     Edward.--&quot;For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU
## 12128       in former days.--In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife!--how I
## 12129       have blushed over the pages of her writing!--and I believe I may say
## 12130       that since the first half year of our foolish--business--this is the
## 12131       only letter I ever received from her, of which the substance made me
## 12132                                   any amends for the defect of the style.&quot;
## 12133                                                                           
## 12134       &quot;However it may have come about,&quot; said Elinor, after a pause,--&quot;they
## 12135      are certainly married.  And your mother has brought on herself a most
## 12136           appropriate punishment.  The independence she settled on Robert,
## 12137    through resentment against you, has put it in his power to make his own
## 12138          choice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand
## 12139           a-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for
## 12140     intending to do.  She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert&#39;s
## 12141             marrying Lucy, than she would have been by your marrying her.&quot;
## 12142                                                                           
## 12143    &quot;She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite.--She
## 12144        will be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him
## 12145                                                              much sooner.&quot;
## 12146                                                                           
## 12147        In what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew
## 12148    not, for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted
## 12149          by him.  He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after
## 12150    Lucy&#39;s letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the nearest
## 12151     road to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct, with
## 12152    which that road did not hold the most intimate connection.  He could do
## 12153    nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood; and by his
## 12154       rapidity in seeking THAT fate, it is to be supposed, in spite of the
## 12155    jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite of
## 12156        the modesty with which he rated his own deserts, and the politeness
## 12157     with which he talked of his doubts, he did not, upon the whole, expect
## 12158      a very cruel reception.  It was his business, however, to say that he
## 12159     DID, and he said it very prettily.  What he might say on the subject a
## 12160     twelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination of husbands and
## 12161                                                                     wives.
## 12162                                                                           
## 12163     That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of
## 12164        malice against him in her message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to
## 12165              Elinor; and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on her
## 12166           character, had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost
## 12167       meanness of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long opened,
## 12168     even before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her ignorance and a
## 12169          want of liberality in some of her opinions--they had been equally
## 12170        imputed, by him, to her want of education; and till her last letter
## 12171             reached him, he had always believed her to be a well-disposed,
## 12172        good-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself.  Nothing but
## 12173            such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an
## 12174    engagement, which, long before the discovery of it laid him open to his
## 12175      mother&#39;s anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to
## 12176                                                                       him.
## 12177                                                                           
## 12178      &quot;I thought it my duty,&quot; said he, &quot;independent of my feelings, to give
## 12179             her the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was
## 12180    renounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend in
## 12181          the world to assist me.  In such a situation as that, where there
## 12182            seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living
## 12183            creature, how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly
## 12184      insisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but
## 12185      the most disinterested affection was her inducement?  And even now, I
## 12186      cannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage
## 12187       it could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the
## 12188        smallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.
## 12189        She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living.&quot;
## 12190                                                                           
## 12191      &quot;No; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour;
## 12192      that your own family might in time relent.  And at any rate, she lost
## 12193           nothing by continuing the engagement, for she has proved that it
## 12194      fettered neither her inclination nor her actions.  The connection was
## 12195         certainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration
## 12196    among her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it would
## 12197                            be better for her to marry YOU than be single.&quot;
## 12198                                                                           
## 12199       Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have
## 12200      been more natural than Lucy&#39;s conduct, nor more self-evident than the
## 12201                                                              motive of it.
## 12202                                                                           
## 12203    Elinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which
## 12204         compliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them at
## 12205                       Norland, when he must have felt his own inconstancy.
## 12206                                                                           
## 12207      &quot;Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,&quot; said she; &quot;because--to say
## 12208     nothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to
## 12209         fancy and expect WHAT, as you were THEN situated, could never be.&quot;
## 12210                                                                           
## 12211          He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart, and a mistaken
## 12212                                 confidence in the force of his engagement.
## 12213                                                                           
## 12214       &quot;I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH was plighted to
## 12215       another, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the
## 12216     consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred
## 12217    as my honour.  I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was only
## 12218      friendship; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and
## 12219      Lucy, I did not know how far I was got.  After that, I suppose, I WAS
## 12220       wrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which I
## 12221             reconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than
## 12222          these:--The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but
## 12223                                                                   myself.&quot;
## 12224                                                                           
## 12225                                         Elinor smiled, and shook her head.
## 12226                                                                           
## 12227      Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon&#39;s being expected at the
## 12228    Cottage, as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him,
## 12229    but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented
## 12230       his giving him the living of Delaford--&quot;Which, at present,&quot; said he,
## 12231      &quot;after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion,
## 12232                     he must think I have never forgiven him for offering.&quot;
## 12233                                                                           
## 12234    NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place.
## 12235    But so little interest had he taken in the matter, that he owed all his
## 12236           knowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the parish,
## 12237      condition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself, who
## 12238    had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard it with so much
## 12239                      attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.
## 12240                                                                           
## 12241         One question after this only remained undecided, between them, one
## 12242         difficulty only was to be overcome.  They were brought together by
## 12243      mutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends;
## 12244      their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness
## 12245      certain--and they only wanted something to live upon.  Edward had two
## 12246      thousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all
## 12247            that they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs.
## 12248      Dashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite
## 12249         enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year
## 12250                               would supply them with the comforts of life.
## 12251                                                                           
## 12252     Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his
## 12253         mother towards him; and on THAT he rested for the residue of their
## 12254         income.  But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would
## 12255     still be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself had been
## 12256      spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s flattering language as only a lesser evil
## 12257       than his chusing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert&#39;s offence would
## 12258                               serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.
## 12259                                                                           
## 12260        About four days after Edward&#39;s arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to
## 12261      complete Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s satisfaction, and to give her the dignity of
## 12262        having, for the first time since her living at Barton, more company
## 12263      with her than her house would hold.  Edward was allowed to retain the
## 12264       privilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every
## 12265     night to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returned
## 12266    in the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers&#39; first tete-a-tete
## 12267                                                          before breakfast.
## 12268                                                                           
## 12269       A three weeks&#39; residence at Delaford, where, in his evening hours at
## 12270      least, he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between
## 12271        thirty-six and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind
## 12272     which needed all the improvement in Marianne&#39;s looks, all the kindness
## 12273     of her welcome, and all the encouragement of her mother&#39;s language, to
## 12274      make it cheerful.  Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he
## 12275    did revive.  No rumour of Lucy&#39;s marriage had yet reached him:--he knew
## 12276          nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were
## 12277           consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.  Every thing was
## 12278    explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to rejoice
## 12279      in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the
## 12280                                                        interest of Elinor.
## 12281                                                                           
## 12282       It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the good
## 12283      opinion of each other, as they advanced in each other&#39;s acquaintance,
## 12284       for it could not be otherwise.  Their resemblance in good principles
## 12285      and good sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably
## 12286        have been sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any other
## 12287      attraction; but their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters
## 12288      fond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,
## 12289         which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment.
## 12290                                                                           
## 12291       The letters from town, which a few days before would have made every
## 12292       nerve in Elinor&#39;s body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read
## 12293             with less emotion than mirth.  Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the
## 12294         wonderful tale, to vent her honest indignation against the jilting
## 12295      girl, and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she
## 12296    was sure, had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by all
## 12297            accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.-- &quot;I do think,&quot; she
## 12298    continued, &quot;nothing was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two days
## 12299          before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me.  Not a soul
## 12300    suspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!  came
## 12301    crying to me the day after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars,
## 12302           as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems
## 12303    borrowed all her money before she went off to be married, on purpose we
## 12304     suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in
## 12305        the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her
## 12306       down to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with
## 12307          Mrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor
## 12308        again.  And I must say that Lucy&#39;s crossness not to take them along
## 12309      with them in the chaise is worse than all.  Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot
## 12310      get him out of my head, but you must send for him to Barton, and Miss
## 12311                                         Marianne must try to comfort him.&quot;
## 12312                                                                           
## 12313        Mr. Dashwood&#39;s strains were more solemn.  Mrs. Ferrars was the most
## 12314                   unfortunate of women--poor Fanny had suffered agonies of
## 12315         sensibility--and he considered the existence of each, under such a
## 12316        blow, with grateful wonder.  Robert&#39;s offence was unpardonable, but
## 12317        Lucy&#39;s was infinitely worse.  Neither of them were ever again to be
## 12318     mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even, if she might hereafter be induced
## 12319           to forgive her son, his wife should never be acknowledged as her
## 12320    daughter, nor be permitted to appear in her presence.  The secrecy with
## 12321          which everything had been carried on between them, was rationally
## 12322    treated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any suspicion
## 12323     of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have been taken to
## 12324          prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join with him in
## 12325          regretting that Lucy&#39;s engagement with Edward had not rather been
## 12326      fulfilled, than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery
## 12327                                farther in the family.-- He thus continued:
## 12328                                                                           
## 12329        &quot;Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward&#39;s name, which does not
## 12330           surprise us; but, to our great astonishment, not a line has been
## 12331    received from him on the occasion.  Perhaps, however, he is kept silent
## 12332    by his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a
## 12333        line to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper
## 12334       submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shewn to
## 12335    her mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness of
## 12336     Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be
## 12337                                          on good terms with her children.&quot;
## 12338                                                                           
## 12339      This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of
## 12340         Edward.  It determined him to attempt a reconciliation, though not
## 12341             exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.
## 12342                                                                           
## 12343      &quot;A letter of proper submission!&quot; repeated he; &quot;would they have me beg
## 12344          my mother&#39;s pardon for Robert&#39;s ingratitude to HER, and breach of
## 12345     honour to ME?--I can make no submission--I am grown neither humble nor
## 12346    penitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy; but that would not
## 12347         interest.--I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make.&quot;
## 12348                                                                           
## 12349     &quot;You may certainly ask to be forgiven,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;because you have
## 12350           offended;--and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to
## 12351      profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew
## 12352                                               on you your mother&#39;s anger.&quot;
## 12353                                                                           
## 12354                                                   He agreed that he might.
## 12355                                                                           
## 12356           &quot;And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be
## 12357    convenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as imprudent
## 12358                                                 in HER eyes as the first.&quot;
## 12359                                                                           
## 12360        He had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a
## 12361      letter of proper submission; and therefore, to make it easier to him,
## 12362      as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by
## 12363      word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that, instead of writing
## 12364          to Fanny, he should go to London, and personally intreat her good
## 12365      offices in his favour.-- &quot;And if they really DO interest themselves,&quot;
## 12366       said Marianne, in her new character of candour, &quot;in bringing about a
## 12367    reconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely
## 12368                                                            without merit.&quot;
## 12369                                                                           
## 12370    After a visit on Colonel Brandon&#39;s side of only three or four days, the
## 12371    two gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately to
## 12372     Delaford, that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future
## 12373    home, and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements
## 12374        were needed to it; and from thence, after staying there a couple of
## 12375                          nights, he was to proceed on his journey to town.
## 12376                                                                           
## 12377                                                                           
## 12378                                                                           
## 12379                                                                 CHAPTER 50
## 12380                                                                           
## 12381                                                                           
## 12382     After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violent
## 12383       and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always
## 12384     seemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edward
## 12385          was admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.
## 12386                                                                           
## 12387    Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.  For many years of
## 12388    her life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of Edward
## 12389        a few weeks ago, had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of
## 12390           Robert had left her for a fortnight without any; and now, by the
## 12391                                resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.
## 12392                                                                           
## 12393       In spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not
## 12394     feel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his
## 12395           present engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he
## 12396    feared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him off
## 12397          as rapidly as before.  With apprehensive caution therefore it was
## 12398           revealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness.  Mrs.
## 12399      Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying
## 12400     Miss Dashwood, by every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss
## 12401       Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--and
## 12402     enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter
## 12403    of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only
## 12404      the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE; but when
## 12405                she found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her
## 12406        representation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she
## 12407          judged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit--and
## 12408           therefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own
## 12409        dignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she
## 12410         issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.
## 12411                                                                           
## 12412    What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to
## 12413    be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now
## 12414          her only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was
## 12415         inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest
## 12416      objection was made against Edward&#39;s taking orders for the sake of two
## 12417      hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for
## 12418        the present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had
## 12419                                                     been given with Fanny.
## 12420                                                                           
## 12421    It was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, by
## 12422     Edward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,
## 12423                   seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.
## 12424                                                                           
## 12425       With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,
## 12426         they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the
## 12427     living, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with
## 12428                an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making
## 12429           considerable improvements; and after waiting some time for their
## 12430       completion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments
## 12431     and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,
## 12432      as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying
## 12433          till every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton
## 12434                                                church early in the autumn.
## 12435                                                                           
## 12436    The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the
## 12437      Mansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the
## 12438        Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--could
## 12439    chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.  Mrs. Jennings&#39;s
## 12440    prophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; for
## 12441            she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by
## 12442         Michaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her husband, as she really
## 12443      believed, one of the happiest couples in the world.  They had in fact
## 12444     nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne,
## 12445                                and rather better pasturage for their cows.
## 12446                                                                           
## 12447    They were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations
## 12448     and friends.  Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was
## 12449    almost ashamed of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at the
## 12450                        expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.
## 12451                                                                           
## 12452     &quot;I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,&quot; said John, as
## 12453        they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford
## 12454     House, &quot;THAT would be saying too much, for certainly you have been one
## 12455          of the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is.  But, I
## 12456           confess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon
## 12457       brother.  His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in
## 12458      such respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I have not
## 12459     seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in
## 12460       Delaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly
## 12461    the person to attract him--yet I think it would altogether be advisable
## 12462       for you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel
## 12463               Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may
## 12464       happen--for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of
## 12465        anybody else--and it will always be in your power to set her off to
## 12466             advantage, and so forth;--in short, you may as well give her a
## 12467                                              chance--You understand me.&quot;--
## 12468                                                                           
## 12469      But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always treated them
## 12470     with the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by
## 12471      her real favour and preference.  THAT was due to the folly of Robert,
## 12472         and the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before many
## 12473     months had passed away.  The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had
## 12474     at first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of
## 12475            his deliverance from it; for her respectful humility, assiduous
## 12476    attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was
## 12477       given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, and
## 12478                               re-established him completely in her favour.
## 12479                                                                           
## 12480      The whole of Lucy&#39;s behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which
## 12481    crowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance
## 12482       of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however
## 12483       its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every
## 12484        advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and
## 12485      conscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privately
## 12486     visited her in Bartlett&#39;s Buildings, it was only with the view imputed
## 12487     to him by his brother.  He merely meant to persuade her to give up the
## 12488    engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection
## 12489     of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle
## 12490         the matter.  In that point, however, and that only, he erred;--for
## 12491      though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her
## 12492         in TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to
## 12493     produce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered in her mind when
## 12494            they parted, which could only be removed by another half hour&#39;s
## 12495     discourse with himself.  His attendance was by this means secured, and
## 12496      the rest followed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward, they came
## 12497        gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had always
## 12498           more to say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed an
## 12499           interest even equal to his own; and in short, it became speedily
## 12500      evident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.  He was
## 12501         proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of
## 12502         marrying privately without his mother&#39;s consent.  What immediately
## 12503          followed is known.  They passed some months in great happiness at
## 12504      Dawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut--and
## 12505           he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--and from thence
## 12506        returning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the
## 12507           simple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy&#39;s instigation, was
## 12508            adopted.  The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable,
## 12509    comprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and
## 12510          therefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks
## 12511            longer unpardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct and
## 12512     messages, in self-condemnation for Robert&#39;s offence, and gratitude for
## 12513      the unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty
## 12514    notice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards,
## 12515         by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.
## 12516       Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny;
## 12517     and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended
## 12518     to marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in fortune and birth,
## 12519       was spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, and
## 12520      always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.  They settled in
## 12521      town, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the
## 12522            best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the
## 12523     jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,
## 12524     in which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent
## 12525         domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing
## 12526                 could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together.
## 12527                                                                           
## 12528        What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have
## 12529    puzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to
## 12530            it, might have puzzled them still more.  It was an arrangement,
## 12531        however, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing
## 12532          ever appeared in Robert&#39;s style of living or of talking to give a
## 12533    suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either leaving
## 12534       his brother too little, or bringing himself too much;--and if Edward
## 12535            might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every
## 12536    particular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, and
## 12537      from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no
## 12538            less contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an
## 12539                                                                  exchange.
## 12540                                                                           
## 12541      Elinor&#39;s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well
## 12542    be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless,
## 12543       for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with
## 12544    her.  Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure
## 12545       in the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringing
## 12546      Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though
## 12547          rather more liberal than what John had expressed.  It was now her
## 12548       darling object.  Precious as was the company of her daughter to her,
## 12549    she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her
## 12550        valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was
## 12551    equally the wish of Edward and Elinor.  They each felt his sorrows, and
## 12552     their own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the
## 12553                                                             reward of all.
## 12554                                                                           
## 12555       With such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge so intimate of
## 12556         his goodness--with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself,
## 12557            which at last, though long after it was observable to everybody
## 12558                                     else--burst on her--what could she do?
## 12559                                                                           
## 12560      Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate.  She was born to
## 12561      discover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her
## 12562           conduct, her most favourite maxims.  She was born to overcome an
## 12563    affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment
## 12564       superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give
## 12565       her hand to another!--and THAT other, a man who had suffered no less
## 12566       than herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years
## 12567    before, she had considered too old to be married,--and who still sought
## 12568                       the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!
## 12569                                                                           
## 12570          But so it was.  Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible
## 12571 passion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,--instead
## 12572           of remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her only
## 12573      pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her more calm and
## 12574      sober judgment she had determined on,--she found herself at nineteen,
## 12575     submitting to new attachments, entering on new duties, placed in a new
## 12576    home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.
## 12577                                                                           
## 12578         Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,
## 12579    believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every past
## 12580    affliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to animation,
## 12581           and his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own
## 12582        happiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight of
## 12583       each observing friend.  Marianne could never love by halves; and her
## 12584     whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had
## 12585                                                   once been to Willoughby.
## 12586                                                                           
## 12587          Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his
## 12588    punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of
## 12589     Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as
## 12590      the source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he
## 12591     behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy
## 12592       and rich.  That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its
## 12593        own punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;--nor that he long
## 12594    thought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.  But
## 12595           that he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or
## 12596    contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must
## 12597            not be depended on--for he did neither.  He lived to exert, and
## 12598       frequently to enjoy himself.  His wife was not always out of humour,
## 12599    nor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,
## 12600        and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree of
## 12601                                                         domestic felicity.
## 12602                                                                           
## 12603         For Marianne, however--in spite of his incivility in surviving her
## 12604       loss--he always retained that decided regard which interested him in
## 12605           every thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of
## 12606    perfection in woman;--and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him
## 12607                  in after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.
## 12608                                                                           
## 12609         Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without
## 12610    attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs.
## 12611       Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an
## 12612         age highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being
## 12613                                                  supposed to have a lover.
## 12614                                                                           
## 12615         Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication
## 12616      which strong family affection would naturally dictate;--and among the
## 12617      merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked
## 12618          as the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost
## 12619           within sight of each other, they could live without disagreement

<pre><code>##     [1] &quot;The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.  Their estate&quot;       
##     [2] &quot;was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of&quot;        
##     [3] &quot;their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so&quot;           
##     [4] &quot;respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their&quot;         
##     [5] &quot;surrounding acquaintance.  The late owner of this estate was a single&quot;       
##     [6] &quot;man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his&quot;        
##     [7] &quot;life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.  But her&quot;      
##     [8] &quot;death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great&quot;            
##     [9] &quot;alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received&quot;     
##    [10] &quot;into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal&quot;       
##    [11] &quot;inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to&quot;      
##    [12] &quot;bequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece, and their&quot;             
##    [13] &quot;children, the old Gentleman&#39;s days were comfortably spent.  His&quot;             
##    [14] &quot;attachment to them all increased.  The constant attention of Mr. and&quot;        
##    [15] &quot;Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from&quot;          
##    [16] &quot;interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid&quot;        
##    [17] &quot;comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the&quot;            
##    [18] &quot;children added a relish to his existence.&quot;                                   
##    [19] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##    [20] &quot;By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present&quot;        
##    [21] &quot;lady, three daughters.  The son, a steady respectable young man, was&quot;        
##    [22] &quot;amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,&quot;      
##    [23] &quot;and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.  By his own&quot;         
##    [24] &quot;marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his&quot;         
##    [25] &quot;wealth.  To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not&quot;      
##    [26] &quot;so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent&quot;       
##    [27] &quot;of what might arise to them from their father&#39;s inheriting that&quot;             
##    [28] &quot;property, could be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and their&quot;          
##    [29] &quot;father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the&quot;              
##    [30] &quot;remaining moiety of his first wife&#39;s fortune was also secured to her&quot;        
##    [31] &quot;child, and he had only a life-interest in it.&quot;                               
##    [32] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##    [33] &quot;The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other&quot;      
##    [34] &quot;will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure.  He was neither so&quot;           
##    [35] &quot;unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but&quot;     
##    [36] &quot;he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the&quot;          
##    [37] &quot;bequest.  Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife&quot;      
##    [38] &quot;and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to his son, and his&quot;         
##    [39] &quot;son&#39;s son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as&quot;     
##    [40] &quot;to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear&quot;      
##    [41] &quot;to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or&quot;     
##    [42] &quot;by any sale of its valuable woods.  The whole was tied up for the&quot;           
##    [43] &quot;benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and&quot;        
##    [44] &quot;mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by&quot;     
##    [45] &quot;such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three&quot;     
##    [46] &quot;years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his&quot;       
##    [47] &quot;own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh&quot;     
##    [48] &quot;all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received&quot;        
##    [49] &quot;from his niece and her daughters.  He meant not to be unkind, however,&quot;      
##    [50] &quot;and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a&quot;         
##    [51] &quot;thousand pounds a-piece.&quot;                                                    
##    [52] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##    [53] &quot;Mr. Dashwood&#39;s disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was&quot;     
##    [54] &quot;cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years,&quot;     
##    [55] &quot;and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce&quot;      
##    [56] &quot;of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate&quot;                 
##    [57] &quot;improvement.  But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was&quot;       
##    [58] &quot;his only one twelvemonth.  He survived his uncle no longer; and ten&quot;         
##    [59] &quot;thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for&quot;     
##    [60] &quot;his widow and daughters.&quot;                                                    
##    [61] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##    [62] &quot;His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.&quot;        
##    [63] &quot;Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness&quot;       
##    [64] &quot;could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.&quot;               
##    [65] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##    [66] &quot;Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the&quot;            
##    [67] &quot;family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at&quot;         
##    [68] &quot;such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make&quot;         
##    [69] &quot;them comfortable.  His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,&quot;       
##    [70] &quot;and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might&quot;     
##    [71] &quot;prudently be in his power to do for them.&quot;                                   
##    [72] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##    [73] &quot;He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted&quot;      
##    [74] &quot;and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well&quot;      
##    [75] &quot;respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of&quot;      
##    [76] &quot;his ordinary duties.  Had he married a more amiable woman, he might&quot;         
##    [77] &quot;have been made still more respectable than he was:--he might even have&quot;      
##    [78] &quot;been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and&quot;       
##    [79] &quot;very fond of his wife.  But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature&quot;      
##    [80] &quot;of himself;--more narrow-minded and selfish.&quot;                                
##    [81] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##    [82] &quot;When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to&quot;      
##    [83] &quot;increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand&quot;           
##    [84] &quot;pounds a-piece.  He then really thought himself equal to it.  The&quot;           
##    [85] &quot;prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,&quot;        
##    [86] &quot;besides the remaining half of his own mother&#39;s fortune, warmed his&quot;          
##    [87] &quot;heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.-- \&quot;Yes, he would give&quot;      
##    [88] &quot;them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would&quot;      
##    [89] &quot;be enough to make them completely easy.  Three thousand pounds! he&quot;          
##    [90] &quot;could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\&quot;-- He&quot;         
##    [91] &quot;thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did&quot;      
##    [92] &quot;not repent.&quot;                                                                 
##    [93] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##    [94] &quot;No sooner was his father&#39;s funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,&quot;           
##    [95] &quot;without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,&quot;           
##    [96] &quot;arrived with her child and their attendants.  No one could dispute her&quot;      
##    [97] &quot;right to come; the house was her husband&#39;s from the moment of his&quot;           
##    [98] &quot;father&#39;s decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the&quot;         
##    [99] &quot;greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s situation, with only common&quot;      
##   [100] &quot;feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--but in HER mind there was&quot;      
##   [101] &quot;a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of&quot;     
##   [102] &quot;the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of&quot;           
##   [103] &quot;immovable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with&quot;      
##   [104] &quot;any of her husband&#39;s family; but she had had no opportunity, till the&quot;       
##   [105] &quot;present, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of&quot;        
##   [106] &quot;other people she could act when occasion required it.&quot;                       
##   [107] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [108] &quot;So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so&quot;         
##   [109] &quot;earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the&quot;          
##   [110] &quot;arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had&quot;       
##   [111] &quot;not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the&quot;     
##   [112] &quot;propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children&quot;      
##   [113] &quot;determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach&quot;       
##   [114] &quot;with their brother.&quot;                                                         
##   [115] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [116] &quot;Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed&quot;      
##   [117] &quot;a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified&quot;      
##   [118] &quot;her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and&quot;          
##   [119] &quot;enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,&quot;         
##   [120] &quot;that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led&quot;       
##   [121] &quot;to imprudence.  She had an excellent heart;--her disposition was&quot;            
##   [122] &quot;affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern&quot;      
##   [123] &quot;them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which&quot;       
##   [124] &quot;one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.&quot;                         
##   [125] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [126] &quot;Marianne&#39;s abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor&#39;s.&quot;       
##   [127] &quot;She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her&quot;      
##   [128] &quot;joys, could have no moderation.  She was generous, amiable,&quot;                 
##   [129] &quot;interesting: she was everything but prudent.  The resemblance between&quot;       
##   [130] &quot;her and her mother was strikingly great.&quot;                                    
##   [131] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [132] &quot;Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister&#39;s sensibility; but&quot;       
##   [133] &quot;by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished.  They encouraged each&quot;         
##   [134] &quot;other now in the violence of their affliction.  The agony of grief&quot;          
##   [135] &quot;which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought&quot;        
##   [136] &quot;for, was created again and again.  They gave themselves up wholly to&quot;        
##   [137] &quot;their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that&quot;     
##   [138] &quot;could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in&quot;         
##   [139] &quot;future.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could&quot;             
##   [140] &quot;struggle, she could exert herself.  She could consult with her brother,&quot;     
##   [141] &quot;could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with&quot;          
##   [142] &quot;proper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar&quot;           
##   [143] &quot;exertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.&quot;                         
##   [144] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [145] &quot;Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but&quot;     
##   [146] &quot;as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne&#39;s romance, without&quot;       
##   [147] &quot;having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal&quot;       
##   [148] &quot;her sisters at a more advanced period of life.&quot;                              
##   [149] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [150] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [151] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [152] &quot;CHAPTER 2&quot;                                                                   
##   [153] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [154] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [155] &quot;Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her&quot;       
##   [156] &quot;mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.&quot;       
##   [157] &quot;As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by&quot;      
##   [158] &quot;her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody&quot;          
##   [159] &quot;beyond himself, his wife, and their child.  He really pressed them,&quot;         
##   [160] &quot;with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no&quot;        
##   [161] &quot;plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she&quot;      
##   [162] &quot;could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his&quot;            
##   [163] &quot;invitation was accepted.&quot;                                                    
##   [164] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [165] &quot;A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former&quot;            
##   [166] &quot;delight, was exactly what suited her mind.  In seasons of cheerfulness,&quot;     
##   [167] &quot;no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater&quot;        
##   [168] &quot;degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness&quot;           
##   [169] &quot;itself.  But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,&quot;       
##   [170] &quot;and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.&quot;          
##   [171] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [172] &quot;Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended&quot;      
##   [173] &quot;to do for his sisters.  To take three thousand pounds from the fortune&quot;      
##   [174] &quot;of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most&quot;             
##   [175] &quot;dreadful degree.  She begged him to think again on the subject.  How&quot;        
##   [176] &quot;could he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too,&quot;     
##   [177] &quot;of so large a sum?  And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods,&quot;       
##   [178] &quot;who were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as no&quot;      
##   [179] &quot;relationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount.  It&quot;      
##   [180] &quot;was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist&quot;            
##   [181] &quot;between the children of any man by different marriages; and why was he&quot;      
##   [182] &quot;to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all his&quot;        
##   [183] &quot;money to his half sisters?&quot;                                                  
##   [184] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [185] &quot;\&quot;It was my father&#39;s last request to me,\&quot; replied her husband, \&quot;that I&quot;    
##   [186] &quot;should assist his widow and daughters.\&quot;&quot;                                    
##   [187] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [188] &quot;\&quot;He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he&quot;     
##   [189] &quot;was light-headed at the time.  Had he been in his right senses, he&quot;          
##   [190] &quot;could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half&quot;     
##   [191] &quot;your fortune from your own child.\&quot;&quot;                                         
##   [192] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [193] &quot;\&quot;He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only&quot;       
##   [194] &quot;requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their&quot;              
##   [195] &quot;situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do.  Perhaps it&quot;      
##   [196] &quot;would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.  He could&quot;       
##   [197] &quot;hardly suppose I should neglect them.  But as he required the promise,&quot;      
##   [198] &quot;I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time.&quot;        
##   [199] &quot;The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.  Something&quot;        
##   [200] &quot;must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new&quot;       
##   [201] &quot;home.\&quot;&quot;                                                                     
##   [202] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [203] &quot;\&quot;Well, then, LET something be done for them; but THAT something need&quot;       
##   [204] &quot;not be three thousand pounds.  Consider,\&quot; she added, \&quot;that when the&quot;       
##   [205] &quot;money is once parted with, it never can return.  Your sisters will&quot;          
##   [206] &quot;marry, and it will be gone for ever.  If, indeed, it could be restored&quot;      
##   [207] &quot;to our poor little boy--\&quot;&quot;                                                  
##   [208] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [209] &quot;\&quot;Why, to be sure,\&quot; said her husband, very gravely, \&quot;that would make&quot;      
##   [210] &quot;great difference.  The time may come when Harry will regret that so&quot;         
##   [211] &quot;large a sum was parted with.  If he should have a numerous family, for&quot;      
##   [212] &quot;instance, it would be a very convenient addition.\&quot;&quot;                         
##   [213] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [214] &quot;\&quot;To be sure it would.\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##   [215] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [216] &quot;\&quot;Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were&quot;        
##   [217] &quot;diminished one half.--Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious&quot;             
##   [218] &quot;increase to their fortunes!\&quot;&quot;                                               
##   [219] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [220] &quot;\&quot;Oh! beyond anything great!  What brother on earth would do half so&quot;        
##   [221] &quot;much for his sisters, even if REALLY his sisters!  And as it is--only&quot;       
##   [222] &quot;half blood!--But you have such a generous spirit!\&quot;&quot;                         
##   [223] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [224] &quot;\&quot;I would not wish to do any thing mean,\&quot; he replied.  \&quot;One had rather,&quot;   
##   [225] &quot;on such occasions, do too much than too little.  No one, at least, can&quot;      
##   [226] &quot;think I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly&quot;     
##   [227] &quot;expect more.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##   [228] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [229] &quot;\&quot;There is no knowing what THEY may expect,\&quot; said the lady, \&quot;but we are&quot;   
##   [230] &quot;not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can&quot;           
##   [231] &quot;afford to do.\&quot;&quot;                                                             
##   [232] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [233] &quot;\&quot;Certainly--and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds&quot;      
##   [234] &quot;a-piece.  As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have&quot;       
##   [235] &quot;about three thousand pounds on their mother&#39;s death--a very comfortable&quot;     
##   [236] &quot;fortune for any young woman.\&quot;&quot;                                              
##   [237] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [238] &quot;\&quot;To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no&quot;        
##   [239] &quot;addition at all.  They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst&quot;        
##   [240] &quot;them.  If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do&quot;       
##   [241] &quot;not, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten&quot;     
##   [242] &quot;thousand pounds.\&quot;&quot;                                                          
##   [243] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [244] &quot;\&quot;That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the&quot;        
##   [245] &quot;whole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother&quot;      
##   [246] &quot;while she lives, rather than for them--something of the annuity kind I&quot;      
##   [247] &quot;mean.--My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.&quot;     
##   [248] &quot;A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.\&quot;&quot;               
##   [249] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [250] &quot;His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this&quot;         
##   [251] &quot;plan.&quot;                                                                       
##   [252] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [253] &quot;\&quot;To be sure,\&quot; said she, \&quot;it is better than parting with fifteen hundred&quot;  
##   [254] &quot;pounds at once.  But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years&quot;      
##   [255] &quot;we shall be completely taken in.\&quot;&quot;                                          
##   [256] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [257] &quot;\&quot;Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that&quot;          
##   [258] &quot;purchase.\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##   [259] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [260] &quot;\&quot;Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when&quot;       
##   [261] &quot;there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy,&quot;     
##   [262] &quot;and hardly forty.  An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over&quot;     
##   [263] &quot;and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it.  You are not&quot;        
##   [264] &quot;aware of what you are doing.  I have known a great deal of the trouble&quot;      
##   [265] &quot;of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to&quot;        
##   [266] &quot;old superannuated servants by my father&#39;s will, and it is amazing how&quot;       
##   [267] &quot;disagreeable she found it.  Twice every year these annuities were to be&quot;     
##   [268] &quot;paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then&quot;        
##   [269] &quot;one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be&quot;       
##   [270] &quot;no such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.  Her income was not her&quot;     
##   [271] &quot;own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more&quot;        
##   [272] &quot;unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been&quot;          
##   [273] &quot;entirely at my mother&#39;s disposal, without any restriction whatever.  It&quot;     
##   [274] &quot;has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would&quot;        
##   [275] &quot;not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.\&quot;&quot;              
##   [276] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [277] &quot;\&quot;It is certainly an unpleasant thing,\&quot; replied Mr. Dashwood, \&quot;to have&quot;    
##   [278] &quot;those kind of yearly drains on one&#39;s income.  One&#39;s fortune, as your&quot;        
##   [279] &quot;mother justly says, is NOT one&#39;s own.  To be tied down to the regular&quot;       
##   [280] &quot;payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it&quot;      
##   [281] &quot;takes away one&#39;s independence.\&quot;&quot;                                            
##   [282] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [283] &quot;\&quot;Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.  They think&quot;         
##   [284] &quot;themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises&quot;      
##   [285] &quot;no gratitude at all.  If I were you, whatever I did should be done at&quot;       
##   [286] &quot;my own discretion entirely.  I would not bind myself to allow them any&quot;      
##   [287] &quot;thing yearly.  It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a&quot;            
##   [288] &quot;hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.\&quot;&quot;                      
##   [289] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [290] &quot;\&quot;I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should&quot;     
##   [291] &quot;be no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will&quot;       
##   [292] &quot;be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they&quot;          
##   [293] &quot;would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger&quot;      
##   [294] &quot;income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the&quot;       
##   [295] &quot;year.  It will certainly be much the best way.  A present of fifty&quot;          
##   [296] &quot;pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for&quot;          
##   [297] &quot;money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father.\&quot;&quot;   
##   [298] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [299] &quot;\&quot;To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within&quot;      
##   [300] &quot;myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at&quot;        
##   [301] &quot;all.  The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might&quot;      
##   [302] &quot;be reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a&quot;      
##   [303] &quot;comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,&quot;        
##   [304] &quot;and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they&quot;     
##   [305] &quot;are in season.  I&#39;ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,&quot;     
##   [306] &quot;it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.  Do but consider,&quot;      
##   [307] &quot;my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law&quot;        
##   [308] &quot;and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds,&quot;        
##   [309] &quot;besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which&quot;           
##   [310] &quot;brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will&quot;       
##   [311] &quot;pay their mother for their board out of it.  Altogether, they will have&quot;     
##   [312] &quot;five hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want&quot;     
##   [313] &quot;for more than that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will&quot;       
##   [314] &quot;be nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly&quot;       
##   [315] &quot;any servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of&quot;        
##   [316] &quot;any kind!  Only conceive how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a&quot;      
##   [317] &quot;year! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as&quot;     
##   [318] &quot;to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it.  They will&quot;     
##   [319] &quot;be much more able to give YOU something.\&quot;&quot;                                  
##   [320] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [321] &quot;\&quot;Upon my word,\&quot; said Mr. Dashwood, \&quot;I believe you are perfectly right.&quot;   
##   [322] &quot;My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than&quot;       
##   [323] &quot;what you say.  I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil&quot;      
##   [324] &quot;my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you&quot;        
##   [325] &quot;have described.  When my mother removes into another house my services&quot;      
##   [326] &quot;shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can.  Some little&quot;     
##   [327] &quot;present of furniture too may be acceptable then.\&quot;&quot;                          
##   [328] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [329] &quot;\&quot;Certainly,\&quot; returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  \&quot;But, however, ONE thing&quot;      
##   [330] &quot;must be considered.  When your father and mother moved to Norland,&quot;          
##   [331] &quot;though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and&quot;        
##   [332] &quot;linen was saved, and is now left to your mother.  Her house will&quot;            
##   [333] &quot;therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.\&quot;&quot;         
##   [334] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [335] &quot;\&quot;That is a material consideration undoubtedly.  A valuable legacy&quot;          
##   [336] &quot;indeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant&quot;           
##   [337] &quot;addition to our own stock here.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##   [338] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [339] &quot;\&quot;Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what&quot;          
##   [340] &quot;belongs to this house.  A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for&quot;       
##   [341] &quot;any place THEY can ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.&quot;         
##   [342] &quot;Your father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this: that you owe no&quot;     
##   [343] &quot;particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we very&quot;       
##   [344] &quot;well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything in the&quot;     
##   [345] &quot;world to THEM.\&quot;&quot;                                                            
##   [346] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [347] &quot;This argument was irresistible.  It gave to his intentions whatever of&quot;      
##   [348] &quot;decision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would be&quot;      
##   [349] &quot;absolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the&quot;        
##   [350] &quot;widow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts as&quot;     
##   [351] &quot;his own wife pointed out.&quot;                                                   
##   [352] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [353] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [354] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [355] &quot;CHAPTER 3&quot;                                                                   
##   [356] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [357] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [358] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any&quot;              
##   [359] &quot;disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased&quot;       
##   [360] &quot;to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when&quot;        
##   [361] &quot;her spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other&quot;      
##   [362] &quot;exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy&quot;              
##   [363] &quot;remembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her&quot;        
##   [364] &quot;inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for&quot;      
##   [365] &quot;to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.  But she could&quot;         
##   [366] &quot;hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and&quot;       
##   [367] &quot;ease, and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier&quot;        
##   [368] &quot;judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, which&quot;       
##   [369] &quot;her mother would have approved.&quot;                                             
##   [370] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [371] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on&quot;     
##   [372] &quot;the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last&quot;         
##   [373] &quot;earthly reflections.  She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no&quot;        
##   [374] &quot;more than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her&quot;          
##   [375] &quot;daughters&#39; sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was&quot;            
##   [376] &quot;persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her in&quot;     
##   [377] &quot;affluence.  For their brother&#39;s sake, too, for the sake of his own&quot;          
##   [378] &quot;heart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his&quot;     
##   [379] &quot;merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity.  His attentive&quot;      
##   [380] &quot;behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare&quot;       
##   [381] &quot;was dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on the&quot;             
##   [382] &quot;liberality of his intentions.&quot;                                               
##   [383] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [384] &quot;The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for&quot;      
##   [385] &quot;her daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge&quot;       
##   [386] &quot;of her character, which half a year&#39;s residence in her family afforded;&quot;     
##   [387] &quot;and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal&quot;       
##   [388] &quot;affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found it&quot;     
##   [389] &quot;impossible to have lived together so long, had not a particular&quot;             
##   [390] &quot;circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according to&quot;       
##   [391] &quot;the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters&#39; continuance at Norland.&quot;    
##   [392] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [393] &quot;This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and&quot;      
##   [394] &quot;the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing young&quot;      
##   [395] &quot;man, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister&#39;s&quot;       
##   [396] &quot;establishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of&quot;      
##   [397] &quot;his time there.&quot;                                                             
##   [398] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [399] &quot;Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of&quot;             
##   [400] &quot;interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died&quot;       
##   [401] &quot;very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,&quot;       
##   [402] &quot;for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on the&quot;        
##   [403] &quot;will of his mother.  But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either&quot;     
##   [404] &quot;consideration.  It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,&quot;       
##   [405] &quot;that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.&quot;        
##   [406] &quot;It was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune&quot;        
##   [407] &quot;should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of&quot;         
##   [408] &quot;disposition; and that Elinor&#39;s merit should not be acknowledged by&quot;          
##   [409] &quot;every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.&quot;                
##   [410] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [411] &quot;Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any&quot;             
##   [412] &quot;peculiar graces of person or address.  He was not handsome, and his&quot;         
##   [413] &quot;manners required intimacy to make them pleasing.  He was too diffident&quot;      
##   [414] &quot;to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,&quot;        
##   [415] &quot;his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.&quot;         
##   [416] &quot;His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid&quot;            
##   [417] &quot;improvement.  But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to&quot;     
##   [418] &quot;answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him&quot;           
##   [419] &quot;distinguished--as--they hardly knew what.  They wanted him to make a&quot;        
##   [420] &quot;fine figure in the world in some manner or other.  His mother wished to&quot;     
##   [421] &quot;interest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to&quot;       
##   [422] &quot;see him connected with some of the great men of the day.  Mrs. John&quot;         
##   [423] &quot;Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these&quot;       
##   [424] &quot;superior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her&quot;             
##   [425] &quot;ambition to see him driving a barouche.  But Edward had no turn for&quot;         
##   [426] &quot;great men or barouches.  All his wishes centered in domestic comfort&quot;        
##   [427] &quot;and the quiet of private life.  Fortunately he had a younger brother&quot;        
##   [428] &quot;who was more promising.&quot;                                                     
##   [429] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [430] &quot;Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged&quot;        
##   [431] &quot;much of Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s attention; for she was, at that time, in such&quot;       
##   [432] &quot;affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects.  She saw&quot;        
##   [433] &quot;only that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.  He&quot;       
##   [434] &quot;did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation.&quot;     
##   [435] &quot;She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by a&quot;               
##   [436] &quot;reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference&quot;           
##   [437] &quot;between him and his sister.  It was a contrast which recommended him&quot;        
##   [438] &quot;most forcibly to her mother.&quot;                                                
##   [439] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [440] &quot;\&quot;It is enough,\&quot; said she; \&quot;to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough.&quot;     
##   [441] &quot;It implies everything amiable.  I love him already.\&quot;&quot;                       
##   [442] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [443] &quot;\&quot;I think you will like him,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;when you know more of him.\&quot;&quot;  
##   [444] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [445] &quot;\&quot;Like him!\&quot; replied her mother with a smile.  \&quot;I feel no sentiment of&quot;    
##   [446] &quot;approbation inferior to love.\&quot;&quot;                                             
##   [447] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [448] &quot;\&quot;You may esteem him.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##   [449] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [450] &quot;\&quot;I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love.\&quot;&quot;         
##   [451] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [452] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him.  Her manners&quot;       
##   [453] &quot;were attaching, and soon banished his reserve.  She speedily&quot;                
##   [454] &quot;comprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor&quot;        
##   [455] &quot;perhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of his&quot;        
##   [456] &quot;worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all&quot;       
##   [457] &quot;her established ideas of what a young man&#39;s address ought to be, was no&quot;     
##   [458] &quot;longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper&quot;      
##   [459] &quot;affectionate.&quot;                                                               
##   [460] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [461] &quot;No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to&quot;          
##   [462] &quot;Elinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and&quot;        
##   [463] &quot;looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.&quot;                    
##   [464] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [465] &quot;\&quot;In a few months, my dear Marianne.\&quot; said she, \&quot;Elinor will, in all&quot;      
##   [466] &quot;probability be settled for life.  We shall miss her; but SHE will be&quot;        
##   [467] &quot;happy.\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
##   [468] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [469] &quot;\&quot;Oh! Mama, how shall we do without her?\&quot;&quot;                                  
##   [470] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [471] &quot;\&quot;My love, it will be scarcely a separation.  We shall live within a few&quot;    
##   [472] &quot;miles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives.  You will&quot;       
##   [473] &quot;gain a brother, a real, affectionate brother.  I have the highest&quot;           
##   [474] &quot;opinion in the world of Edward&#39;s heart.  But you look grave, Marianne;&quot;      
##   [475] &quot;do you disapprove your sister&#39;s choice?\&quot;&quot;                                   
##   [476] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [477] &quot;\&quot;Perhaps,\&quot; said Marianne, \&quot;I may consider it with some surprise.&quot;         
##   [478] &quot;Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly.  But yet--he is not&quot;        
##   [479] &quot;the kind of young man--there is something wanting--his figure is not&quot;        
##   [480] &quot;striking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man&quot;        
##   [481] &quot;who could seriously attach my sister.  His eyes want all that spirit,&quot;       
##   [482] &quot;that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence.  And besides&quot;     
##   [483] &quot;all this, I am afraid, Mama, he has no real taste.  Music seems&quot;             
##   [484] &quot;scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor&#39;s drawings very&quot;       
##   [485] &quot;much, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their&quot;         
##   [486] &quot;worth.  It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her while&quot;      
##   [487] &quot;she draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matter.  He admires as&quot;      
##   [488] &quot;a lover, not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters must be&quot;     
##   [489] &quot;united.  I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every&quot;       
##   [490] &quot;point coincide with my own.  He must enter into all my feelings; the&quot;        
##   [491] &quot;same books, the same music must charm us both.  Oh! mama, how&quot;               
##   [492] &quot;spiritless, how tame was Edward&#39;s manner in reading to us last night!&quot;       
##   [493] &quot;I felt for my sister most severely.  Yet she bore it with so much&quot;           
##   [494] &quot;composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.  I could hardly keep my&quot;        
##   [495] &quot;seat.  To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost&quot;           
##   [496] &quot;driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such&quot;            
##   [497] &quot;dreadful indifference!\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##   [498] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [499] &quot;\&quot;He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose.&quot;    
##   [500] &quot;I thought so at the time; but you WOULD give him Cowper.\&quot;&quot;                  
##   [501] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [502] &quot;\&quot;Nay, Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--but we must allow&quot;      
##   [503] &quot;for difference of taste.  Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she&quot;     
##   [504] &quot;may overlook it, and be happy with him.  But it would have broke MY&quot;         
##   [505] &quot;heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.&quot;        
##   [506] &quot;Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I&quot;          
##   [507] &quot;shall never see a man whom I can really love.  I require so much!  He&quot;       
##   [508] &quot;must have all Edward&#39;s virtues, and his person and manners must&quot;             
##   [509] &quot;ornament his goodness with every possible charm.\&quot;&quot;                          
##   [510] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [511] &quot;\&quot;Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.  It is yet too early in&quot;    
##   [512] &quot;life to despair of such a happiness.  Why should you be less fortunate&quot;      
##   [513] &quot;than your mother?  In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your&quot;          
##   [514] &quot;destiny be different from hers!\&quot;&quot;                                           
##   [515] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [516] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [517] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [518] &quot;CHAPTER 4&quot;                                                                   
##   [519] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [520] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [521] &quot;\&quot;What a pity it is, Elinor,\&quot; said Marianne, \&quot;that Edward should have no&quot;  
##   [522] &quot;taste for drawing.\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##   [523] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [524] &quot;\&quot;No taste for drawing!\&quot; replied Elinor, \&quot;why should you think so? He&quot;     
##   [525] &quot;does not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the&quot;      
##   [526] &quot;performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means&quot;            
##   [527] &quot;deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of&quot;          
##   [528] &quot;improving it.  Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he&quot;          
##   [529] &quot;would have drawn very well.  He distrusts his own judgment in such&quot;          
##   [530] &quot;matters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any&quot;     
##   [531] &quot;picture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which&quot;      
##   [532] &quot;in general direct him perfectly right.\&quot;&quot;                                    
##   [533] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [534] &quot;Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but&quot;      
##   [535] &quot;the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by the&quot;     
##   [536] &quot;drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight,&quot;         
##   [537] &quot;which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste.  Yet, though&quot;            
##   [538] &quot;smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister for that&quot;     
##   [539] &quot;blind partiality to Edward which produced it.&quot;                               
##   [540] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [541] &quot;\&quot;I hope, Marianne,\&quot; continued Elinor, \&quot;you do not consider him as&quot;        
##   [542] &quot;deficient in general taste.  Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,&quot;     
##   [543] &quot;for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your&quot;       
##   [544] &quot;opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him.\&quot;&quot;                       
##   [545] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [546] &quot;Marianne hardly knew what to say.  She would not wound the feelings of&quot;      
##   [547] &quot;her sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe was&quot;      
##   [548] &quot;impossible.  At length she replied:&quot;                                         
##   [549] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [550] &quot;\&quot;Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thing&quot;     
##   [551] &quot;equal to your sense of his merits.  I have not had so many&quot;                  
##   [552] &quot;opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his&quot;       
##   [553] &quot;inclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion in&quot;     
##   [554] &quot;the world of his goodness and sense.  I think him every thing that is&quot;       
##   [555] &quot;worthy and amiable.\&quot;&quot;                                                       
##   [556] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [557] &quot;\&quot;I am sure,\&quot; replied Elinor, with a smile, \&quot;that his dearest friends&quot;     
##   [558] &quot;could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that.  I do not&quot;         
##   [559] &quot;perceive how you could express yourself more warmly.\&quot;&quot;                      
##   [560] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [561] &quot;Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.&quot;                 
##   [562] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [563] &quot;\&quot;Of his sense and his goodness,\&quot; continued Elinor, \&quot;no one can, I&quot;        
##   [564] &quot;think, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in&quot;          
##   [565] &quot;unreserved conversation.  The excellence of his understanding and his&quot;       
##   [566] &quot;principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps&quot;      
##   [567] &quot;him silent.  You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.&quot;       
##   [568] &quot;But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from&quot;             
##   [569] &quot;peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself.  He and I&quot;       
##   [570] &quot;have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been&quot;         
##   [571] &quot;wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother.  I&quot;        
##   [572] &quot;have seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard&quot;        
##   [573] &quot;his opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I&quot;     
##   [574] &quot;venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books&quot;     
##   [575] &quot;exceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just and&quot;         
##   [576] &quot;correct, and his taste delicate and pure.  His abilities in every&quot;           
##   [577] &quot;respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.&quot;        
##   [578] &quot;At first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person&quot;       
##   [579] &quot;can hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which&quot;       
##   [580] &quot;are uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is&quot;       
##   [581] &quot;perceived.  At present, I know him so well, that I think him really&quot;         
##   [582] &quot;handsome; or at least, almost so.  What say you, Marianne?\&quot;&quot;                
##   [583] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [584] &quot;\&quot;I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now.  When&quot;      
##   [585] &quot;you tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection&quot;      
##   [586] &quot;in his face, than I now do in his heart.\&quot;&quot;                                  
##   [587] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [588] &quot;Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she&quot;        
##   [589] &quot;had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.  She felt that Edward stood&quot;     
##   [590] &quot;very high in her opinion.  She believed the regard to be mutual; but&quot;        
##   [591] &quot;she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne&#39;s conviction of&quot;       
##   [592] &quot;their attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that what Marianne and her&quot;     
##   [593] &quot;mother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them,&quot;      
##   [594] &quot;to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect.  She tried to explain&quot;       
##   [595] &quot;the real state of the case to her sister.&quot;                                   
##   [596] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [597] &quot;\&quot;I do not attempt to deny,\&quot; said she, \&quot;that I think very highly of&quot;       
##   [598] &quot;him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.\&quot;&quot;                              
##   [599] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [600] &quot;Marianne here burst forth with indignation--&quot;                                
##   [601] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [602] &quot;\&quot;Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh!  worse than&quot;                
##   [603] &quot;cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.  Use those words again, and I&quot;     
##   [604] &quot;will leave the room this moment.\&quot;&quot;                                          
##   [605] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [606] &quot;Elinor could not help laughing.  \&quot;Excuse me,\&quot; said she; \&quot;and be assured&quot;  
##   [607] &quot;that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my&quot;       
##   [608] &quot;own feelings.  Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;&quot;            
##   [609] &quot;believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion--the&quot;     
##   [610] &quot;hope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly.&quot;      
##   [611] &quot;But farther than this you must not believe.  I am by no means assured&quot;       
##   [612] &quot;of his regard for me.  There are moments when the extent of it seems&quot;        
##   [613] &quot;doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at&quot;     
##   [614] &quot;my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by&quot;              
##   [615] &quot;believing or calling it more than it is.  In my heart I feel&quot;                
##   [616] &quot;little--scarcely any doubt of his preference.  But there are other&quot;          
##   [617] &quot;points to be considered besides his inclination.  He is very far from&quot;       
##   [618] &quot;being independent.  What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from&quot;     
##   [619] &quot;Fanny&#39;s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never&quot;       
##   [620] &quot;been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if&quot;          
##   [621] &quot;Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in&quot;        
##   [622] &quot;his way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great&quot;     
##   [623] &quot;fortune or high rank.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##   [624] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [625] &quot;Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother&quot;      
##   [626] &quot;and herself had outstripped the truth.&quot;                                      
##   [627] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [628] &quot;\&quot;And you really are not engaged to him!\&quot; said she.  \&quot;Yet it certainly&quot;    
##   [629] &quot;soon will happen.  But two advantages will proceed from this delay.  I&quot;      
##   [630] &quot;shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity of&quot;     
##   [631] &quot;improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be&quot;       
##   [632] &quot;so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.  Oh! if he should&quot;       
##   [633] &quot;be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, how&quot;        
##   [634] &quot;delightful it would be!\&quot;&quot;                                                   
##   [635] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [636] &quot;Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister.  She could not&quot;             
##   [637] &quot;consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne&quot;     
##   [638] &quot;had believed it.  There was, at times, a want of spirits about him&quot;          
##   [639] &quot;which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as&quot;      
##   [640] &quot;unpromising.  A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not&quot;     
##   [641] &quot;give him more than inquietude.  It would not be likely to produce that&quot;      
##   [642] &quot;dejection of mind which frequently attended him.  A more reasonable&quot;         
##   [643] &quot;cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the&quot;           
##   [644] &quot;indulgence of his affection.  She knew that his mother neither behaved&quot;      
##   [645] &quot;to him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give him&quot;       
##   [646] &quot;any assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictly&quot;       
##   [647] &quot;attending to her views for his aggrandizement.  With such a knowledge&quot;       
##   [648] &quot;as this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.  She&quot;     
##   [649] &quot;was far from depending on that result of his preference of her, which&quot;       
##   [650] &quot;her mother and sister still considered as certain.  Nay, the longer&quot;         
##   [651] &quot;they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard;&quot;       
##   [652] &quot;and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more&quot;     
##   [653] &quot;than friendship.&quot;                                                            
##   [654] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [655] &quot;But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived&quot;     
##   [656] &quot;by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, (which was&quot;         
##   [657] &quot;still more common,) to make her uncivil.  She took the first&quot;                
##   [658] &quot;opportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to&quot;     
##   [659] &quot;her so expressively of her brother&#39;s great expectations, of Mrs.&quot;            
##   [660] &quot;Ferrars&#39;s resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the&quot;       
##   [661] &quot;danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that&quot;         
##   [662] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to&quot;      
##   [663] &quot;be calm.  She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and&quot;             
##   [664] &quot;instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the&quot;              
##   [665] &quot;inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor&quot;         
##   [666] &quot;should not be exposed another week to such insinuations.&quot;                    
##   [667] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [668] &quot;In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the&quot;        
##   [669] &quot;post, which contained a proposal particularly well timed.  It was the&quot;       
##   [670] &quot;offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of&quot;      
##   [671] &quot;her own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.  The&quot;        
##   [672] &quot;letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit&quot;      
##   [673] &quot;of friendly accommodation.  He understood that she was in need of a&quot;         
##   [674] &quot;dwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,&quot;     
##   [675] &quot;he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might&quot;         
##   [676] &quot;think necessary, if the situation pleased her.  He earnestly pressed&quot;        
##   [677] &quot;her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come with&quot;     
##   [678] &quot;her daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from&quot;          
##   [679] &quot;whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houses&quot;     
##   [680] &quot;were in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable&quot;      
##   [681] &quot;to her.  He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of&quot;      
##   [682] &quot;his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of&quot;          
##   [683] &quot;giving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was&quot;     
##   [684] &quot;suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer&quot;              
##   [685] &quot;connections.  She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry.  Her&quot;          
##   [686] &quot;resolution was formed as she read.  The situation of Barton, in a&quot;           
##   [687] &quot;county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours&quot;     
##   [688] &quot;before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every&quot;            
##   [689] &quot;possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first&quot;                
##   [690] &quot;recommendation.  To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an&quot;      
##   [691] &quot;evil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison of&quot;       
##   [692] &quot;the misery of continuing her daughter-in-law&#39;s guest; and to remove for&quot;     
##   [693] &quot;ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or&quot;       
##   [694] &quot;visit it while such a woman was its mistress.  She instantly wrote Sir&quot;      
##   [695] &quot;John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance&quot;       
##   [696] &quot;of his proposal; and then hastened to shew both letters to her&quot;              
##   [697] &quot;daughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before her&quot;         
##   [698] &quot;answer were sent.&quot;                                                           
##   [699] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [700] &quot;Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle&quot;       
##   [701] &quot;at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present&quot;       
##   [702] &quot;acquaintance.  On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose&quot;        
##   [703] &quot;her mother&#39;s intention of removing into Devonshire.  The house, too, as&quot;     
##   [704] &quot;described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so&quot;            
##   [705] &quot;uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either&quot;        
##   [706] &quot;point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charm&quot;     
##   [707] &quot;to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland&quot;          
##   [708] &quot;beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from&quot;          
##   [709] &quot;sending a letter of acquiescence.&quot;                                           
##   [710] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [711] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [712] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [713] &quot;CHAPTER 5&quot;                                                                   
##   [714] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [715] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [716] &quot;No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself&quot;    
##   [717] &quot;in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that she&quot;       
##   [718] &quot;was provided with a house, and should incommode them no longer than till&quot;    
##   [719] &quot;every thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They heard her with&quot;           
##   [720] &quot;surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly hoped&quot;    
##   [721] &quot;that she would not be settled far from Norland. She had great&quot;               
##   [722] &quot;satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.--Edward&quot;        
##   [723] &quot;turned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise&quot;    
##   [724] &quot;and concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated,&quot;                
##   [725] &quot;\&quot;Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And to&quot;       
##   [726] &quot;what part of it?\&quot; She explained the situation. It was within four miles&quot;    
##   [727] &quot;northward of Exeter.&quot;                                                        
##   [728] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [729] &quot;\&quot;It is but a cottage,\&quot; she continued, \&quot;but I hope to see many of my&quot;      
##   [730] &quot;friends in it.  A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends&quot;        
##   [731] &quot;find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will&quot;         
##   [732] &quot;find none in accommodating them.\&quot;&quot;                                          
##   [733] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [734] &quot;She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood&quot;     
##   [735] &quot;to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still greater&quot;       
##   [736] &quot;affection.  Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had&quot;       
##   [737] &quot;made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was&quot;                 
##   [738] &quot;unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that&quot;         
##   [739] &quot;point to which it principally tended.  To separate Edward and Elinor&quot;        
##   [740] &quot;was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs.&quot;       
##   [741] &quot;John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally&quot;       
##   [742] &quot;she disregarded her disapprobation of the match.&quot;                            
##   [743] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [744] &quot;Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry&quot;     
##   [745] &quot;he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to&quot;     
##   [746] &quot;prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture.  He&quot;      
##   [747] &quot;really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very&quot;             
##   [748] &quot;exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his&quot;      
##   [749] &quot;father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture&quot;      
##   [750] &quot;was all sent around by water.  It chiefly consisted of household linen,&quot;     
##   [751] &quot;plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne&#39;s.&quot;          
##   [752] &quot;Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could not&quot;       
##   [753] &quot;help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s income would be so&quot;             
##   [754] &quot;trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any handsome&quot;         
##   [755] &quot;article of furniture.&quot;                                                       
##   [756] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [757] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished,&quot;     
##   [758] &quot;and she might have immediate possession.  No difficulty arose on either&quot;     
##   [759] &quot;side in the agreement; and she waited only for the disposal of her&quot;          
##   [760] &quot;effects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before she&quot;       
##   [761] &quot;set off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid in the&quot;         
##   [762] &quot;performance of everything that interested her, was soon done.--The&quot;          
##   [763] &quot;horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his&quot;      
##   [764] &quot;death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage,&quot;        
##   [765] &quot;she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest&quot;        
##   [766] &quot;daughter.  For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her&quot;      
##   [767] &quot;own wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor&quot;            
##   [768] &quot;prevailed.  HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to&quot;          
##   [769] &quot;three; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided from&quot;      
##   [770] &quot;amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.&quot;                
##   [771] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [772] &quot;The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire,&quot;     
##   [773] &quot;to prepare the house for their mistress&#39;s arrival; for as Lady&quot;              
##   [774] &quot;Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going&quot;        
##   [775] &quot;directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she&quot;          
##   [776] &quot;relied so undoubtingly on Sir John&#39;s description of the house, as to&quot;        
##   [777] &quot;feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own.&quot;     
##   [778] &quot;Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by&quot;      
##   [779] &quot;the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her&quot;      
##   [780] &quot;removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed&quot;      
##   [781] &quot;under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.  Now was the&quot;         
##   [782] &quot;time when her son-in-law&#39;s promise to his father might with particular&quot;      
##   [783] &quot;propriety be fulfilled.  Since he had neglected to do it on first&quot;           
##   [784] &quot;coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on as&quot;        
##   [785] &quot;the most suitable period for its accomplishment.  But Mrs. Dashwood&quot;         
##   [786] &quot;began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced,&quot;     
##   [787] &quot;from the general drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended&quot;       
##   [788] &quot;no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.  He so&quot;         
##   [789] &quot;frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and of&quot;        
##   [790] &quot;the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence in&quot;     
##   [791] &quot;the world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to&quot;       
##   [792] &quot;stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving&quot;       
##   [793] &quot;money away.&quot;                                                                 
##   [794] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [795] &quot;In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton&#39;s&quot;         
##   [796] &quot;first letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their future&quot;     
##   [797] &quot;abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their&quot;           
##   [798] &quot;journey.&quot;                                                                    
##   [799] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [800] &quot;Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so&quot;         
##   [801] &quot;much beloved.  \&quot;Dear, dear Norland!\&quot; said Marianne, as she wandered&quot;       
##   [802] &quot;alone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; \&quot;when&quot;    
##   [803] &quot;shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh!&quot;     
##   [804] &quot;happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this&quot;      
##   [805] &quot;spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you, ye&quot;              
##   [806] &quot;well-known trees!--but you will continue the same.--No leaf will decay&quot;      
##   [807] &quot;because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we&quot;        
##   [808] &quot;can observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same; unconscious&quot;

##   [818] &quot;The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a&quot;           
##   [819] &quot;disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant.  But as they&quot;       
##   [820] &quot;drew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a&quot;           
##   [821] &quot;country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view&quot;     
##   [822] &quot;of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.  It was a&quot;       
##   [823] &quot;pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture.  After winding&quot;     
##   [824] &quot;along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house.  A small&quot;       
##   [825] &quot;green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket&quot;        
##   [826] &quot;gate admitted them into it.&quot;                                                 
##   [827] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [828] &quot;As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;&quot;      
##   [829] &quot;but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the&quot;        
##   [830] &quot;roof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were&quot;        
##   [831] &quot;the walls covered with honeysuckles.  A narrow passage led directly&quot;         
##   [832] &quot;through the house into the garden behind.  On each side of the entrance&quot;     
##   [833] &quot;was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were the&quot;     
##   [834] &quot;offices and the stairs.  Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest&quot;     
##   [835] &quot;of the house.  It had not been built many years and was in good repair.&quot;     
##   [836] &quot;In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but the tears&quot;      
##   [837] &quot;which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon&quot;         
##   [838] &quot;dried away.  They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their&quot;          
##   [839] &quot;arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.&quot;      
##   [840] &quot;It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from first&quot;         
##   [841] &quot;seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received an&quot;      
##   [842] &quot;impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending&quot;      
##   [843] &quot;it to their lasting approbation.&quot;                                            
##   [844] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [845] &quot;The situation of the house was good.  High hills rose immediately&quot;           
##   [846] &quot;behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open&quot;      
##   [847] &quot;downs, the others cultivated and woody.  The village of Barton was&quot;          
##   [848] &quot;chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the&quot;          
##   [849] &quot;cottage windows.  The prospect in front was more extensive; it&quot;              
##   [850] &quot;commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.&quot;     
##   [851] &quot;The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that&quot;        
##   [852] &quot;direction; under another name, and in another course, it branched out&quot;       
##   [853] &quot;again between two of the steepest of them.&quot;                                  
##   [854] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [855] &quot;With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the&quot;         
##   [856] &quot;whole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered many&quot;     
##   [857] &quot;additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was a&quot;         
##   [858] &quot;delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply&quot;       
##   [859] &quot;all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.  \&quot;As for the&quot;    
##   [860] &quot;house itself, to be sure,\&quot; said she, \&quot;it is too small for our family,&quot;     
##   [861] &quot;but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as it&quot;     
##   [862] &quot;is too late in the year for improvements.  Perhaps in the spring, if I&quot;      
##   [863] &quot;have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think about&quot;             
##   [864] &quot;building.  These parlors are both too small for such parties of our&quot;         
##   [865] &quot;friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts&quot;     
##   [866] &quot;of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the&quot;         
##   [867] &quot;other, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this,&quot;      
##   [868] &quot;with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamber&quot;        
##   [869] &quot;and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage.  I could&quot;         
##   [870] &quot;wish the stairs were handsome.  But one must not expect every thing;&quot;        
##   [871] &quot;though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them.  I&quot;          
##   [872] &quot;shall see how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring, and&quot;       
##   [873] &quot;we will plan our improvements accordingly.\&quot;&quot;                                
##   [874] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [875] &quot;In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the&quot;         
##   [876] &quot;savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never saved&quot;      
##   [877] &quot;in her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it&quot;     
##   [878] &quot;was; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns,&quot;      
##   [879] &quot;and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, to&quot;     
##   [880] &quot;form themselves a home.  Marianne&#39;s pianoforte was unpacked and&quot;             
##   [881] &quot;properly disposed of; and Elinor&#39;s drawings were affixed to the walls&quot;       
##   [882] &quot;of their sitting room.&quot;                                                      
##   [883] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [884] &quot;In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast&quot;     
##   [885] &quot;the next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcome&quot;       
##   [886] &quot;them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his own&quot;          
##   [887] &quot;house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.  Sir&quot;        
##   [888] &quot;John Middleton was a good looking man about forty.  He had formerly&quot;         
##   [889] &quot;visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young cousins to&quot;           
##   [890] &quot;remember him.  His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured; and his&quot;        
##   [891] &quot;manners were as friendly as the style of his letter.  Their arrival&quot;         
##   [892] &quot;seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to be an&quot;          
##   [893] &quot;object of real solicitude to him.  He said much of his earnest desire&quot;       
##   [894] &quot;of their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressed&quot;     
##   [895] &quot;them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were&quot;           
##   [896] &quot;better settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried to a&quot;       
##   [897] &quot;point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence.&quot;         
##   [898] &quot;His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after he&quot;         
##   [899] &quot;left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from&quot;       
##   [900] &quot;the park, which was followed before the end of the day by a present of&quot;      
##   [901] &quot;game.  He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their letters to and&quot;         
##   [902] &quot;from the post for them, and would not be denied the satisfaction of&quot;         
##   [903] &quot;sending them his newspaper every day.&quot;                                       
##   [904] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [905] &quot;Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting her&quot;           
##   [906] &quot;intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assured&quot;       
##   [907] &quot;that her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message was&quot;           
##   [908] &quot;answered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introduced&quot;       
##   [909] &quot;to them the next day.&quot;                                                       
##   [910] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [911] &quot;They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of&quot;       
##   [912] &quot;their comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her appearance&quot;     
##   [913] &quot;was favourable to their wishes.  Lady Middleton was not more than six&quot;       
##   [914] &quot;or seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall and&quot;             
##   [915] &quot;striking, and her address graceful.  Her manners had all the elegance&quot;       
##   [916] &quot;which her husband&#39;s wanted.  But they would have been improved by some&quot;      
##   [917] &quot;share of his frankness and warmth; and her visit was long enough to&quot;         
##   [918] &quot;detract something from their first admiration, by shewing that, though&quot;      
##   [919] &quot;perfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for&quot;     
##   [920] &quot;herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.&quot;                     
##   [921] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [922] &quot;Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and&quot;      
##   [923] &quot;Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their&quot;     
##   [924] &quot;eldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which means&quot;         
##   [925] &quot;there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of&quot;     
##   [926] &quot;extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty,&quot;     
##   [927] &quot;and ask him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hung&quot;      
##   [928] &quot;about her and held down his head, to the great surprise of her&quot;              
##   [929] &quot;ladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he could&quot;      
##   [930] &quot;make noise enough at home.  On every formal visit a child ought to be&quot;       
##   [931] &quot;of the party, by way of provision for discourse.  In the present case&quot;       
##   [932] &quot;it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his&quot;      
##   [933] &quot;father or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of&quot;        
##   [934] &quot;course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the&quot;            
##   [935] &quot;opinion of the others.&quot;                                                      
##   [936] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [937] &quot;An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the&quot;     
##   [938] &quot;rest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house without&quot;         
##   [939] &quot;securing their promise of dining at the park the next day.&quot;                  
##   [940] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [941] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [942] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [943] &quot;CHAPTER 7&quot;                                                                   
##   [944] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [945] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [946] &quot;Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.  The ladies had&quot;         
##   [947] &quot;passed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from&quot;      
##   [948] &quot;their view at home by the projection of a hill.  The house was large&quot;        
##   [949] &quot;and handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality&quot;      
##   [950] &quot;and elegance.  The former was for Sir John&#39;s gratification, the latter&quot;      
##   [951] &quot;for that of his lady.  They were scarcely ever without some friends&quot;         
##   [952] &quot;staying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every&quot;         
##   [953] &quot;kind than any other family in the neighbourhood.  It was necessary to&quot;       
##   [954] &quot;the happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward&quot;         
##   [955] &quot;behaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of&quot;         
##   [956] &quot;talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with&quot;         
##   [957] &quot;such as society produced, within a very narrow compass.  Sir John was a&quot;     
##   [958] &quot;sportsman, Lady Middleton a mother.  He hunted and shot, and she&quot;            
##   [959] &quot;humoured her children; and these were their only resources.  Lady&quot;           
##   [960] &quot;Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the&quot;     
##   [961] &quot;year round, while Sir John&#39;s independent employments were in existence&quot;      
##   [962] &quot;only half the time.  Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,&quot;     
##   [963] &quot;supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported the&quot;        
##   [964] &quot;good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of his&quot;     
##   [965] &quot;wife.&quot;                                                                       
##   [966] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [967] &quot;Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of&quot;        
##   [968] &quot;all her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her&quot;         
##   [969] &quot;greatest enjoyment in any of their parties.  But Sir John&#39;s&quot;                 
##   [970] &quot;satisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting&quot;      
##   [971] &quot;about him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier&quot;      
##   [972] &quot;they were the better was he pleased.  He was a blessing to all the&quot;          
##   [973] &quot;juvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever&quot;           
##   [974] &quot;forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter&quot;     
##   [975] &quot;his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not&quot;       
##   [976] &quot;suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.&quot;                         
##   [977] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [978] &quot;The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy&quot;       
##   [979] &quot;to him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants&quot;      
##   [980] &quot;he had now procured for his cottage at Barton.  The Miss Dashwoods were&quot;     
##   [981] &quot;young, pretty, and unaffected.  It was enough to secure his good&quot;            
##   [982] &quot;opinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to&quot;      
##   [983] &quot;make her mind as captivating as her person.  The friendliness of his&quot;        
##   [984] &quot;disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation&quot;          
##   [985] &quot;might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate.  In&quot;       
##   [986] &quot;showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction&quot;      
##   [987] &quot;of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his&quot;            
##   [988] &quot;cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman,&quot;       
##   [989] &quot;though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is&quot;      
##   [990] &quot;not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a&quot;        
##   [991] &quot;residence within his own manor.&quot;                                             
##   [992] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##   [993] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by&quot;        
##   [994] &quot;Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity;&quot;       
##   [995] &quot;and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young&quot;           
##   [996] &quot;ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day&quot;        
##   [997] &quot;before, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.  They&quot;      
##   [998] &quot;would see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a&quot;             
##   [999] &quot;particular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither very&quot;     
##  [1000] &quot;young nor very gay.  He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of&quot;        
##  [1001] &quot;the party, and could assure them it should never happen so again.  He&quot;       
##  [1002] &quot;had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some&quot;        
##  [1003] &quot;addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was full&quot;      
##  [1004] &quot;of engagements.  Luckily Lady Middleton&#39;s mother had arrived at Barton&quot;      
##  [1005] &quot;within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman,&quot;       
##  [1006] &quot;he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might&quot;      
##  [1007] &quot;imagine.  The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectly&quot;         
##  [1008] &quot;satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for&quot;     
##  [1009] &quot;no more.&quot;                                                                    
##  [1010] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1011] &quot;Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton&#39;s mother, was a good-humoured, merry,&quot;         
##  [1012] &quot;fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and&quot;         
##  [1013] &quot;rather vulgar.  She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner&quot;       
##  [1014] &quot;was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and&quot;            
##  [1015] &quot;husbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,&quot;       
##  [1016] &quot;and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.  Marianne was&quot;      
##  [1017] &quot;vexed at it for her sister&#39;s sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinor&quot;       
##  [1018] &quot;to see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave&quot;           
##  [1019] &quot;Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery&quot;       
##  [1020] &quot;as Mrs. Jennings&#39;s.&quot;                                                         
##  [1021] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1022] &quot;Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by&quot;          
##  [1023] &quot;resemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be&quot;       
##  [1024] &quot;his wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton&#39;s mother.  He was&quot;           
##  [1025] &quot;silent and grave.  His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite&quot;      
##  [1026] &quot;of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old&quot;        
##  [1027] &quot;bachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though&quot;       
##  [1028] &quot;his face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and his&quot;            
##  [1029] &quot;address was particularly gentlemanlike.&quot;                                     
##  [1030] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1031] &quot;There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as&quot;         
##  [1032] &quot;companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton&quot;      
##  [1033] &quot;was so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity of&quot;      
##  [1034] &quot;Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his&quot;          
##  [1035] &quot;mother-in-law was interesting.  Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to&quot;       
##  [1036] &quot;enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner,&quot;     
##  [1037] &quot;who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of&quot;     
##  [1038] &quot;discourse except what related to themselves.&quot;                                
##  [1039] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1040] &quot;In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was&quot;           
##  [1041] &quot;invited to play.  The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to&quot;       
##  [1042] &quot;be charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went&quot;         
##  [1043] &quot;through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into&quot;        
##  [1044] &quot;the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in&quot;        
##  [1045] &quot;the same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebrated&quot;        
##  [1046] &quot;that event by giving up music, although by her mother&#39;s account, she&quot;        
##  [1047] &quot;had played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.&quot;              
##  [1048] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1049] &quot;Marianne&#39;s performance was highly applauded.  Sir John was loud in his&quot;      
##  [1050] &quot;admiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation&quot;        
##  [1051] &quot;with the others while every song lasted.  Lady Middleton frequently&quot;         
##  [1052] &quot;called him to order, wondered how any one&#39;s attention could be diverted&quot;     
##  [1053] &quot;from music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song&quot;       
##  [1054] &quot;which Marianne had just finished.  Colonel Brandon alone, of all the&quot;        
##  [1055] &quot;party, heard her without being in raptures.  He paid her only the&quot;           
##  [1056] &quot;compliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on the&quot;              
##  [1057] &quot;occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless&quot;      
##  [1058] &quot;want of taste.  His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that&quot;       
##  [1059] &quot;ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, was&quot;             
##  [1060] &quot;estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the&quot;         
##  [1061] &quot;others; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and&quot;       
##  [1062] &quot;thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every&quot;          
##  [1063] &quot;exquisite power of enjoyment.  She was perfectly disposed to make every&quot;     
##  [1064] &quot;allowance for the colonel&#39;s advanced state of life which humanity&quot;           
##  [1065] &quot;required.&quot;                                                                   
##  [1066] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1067] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1068] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1069] &quot;CHAPTER 8&quot;                                                                   
##  [1070] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1071] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1072] &quot;Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.  She had only two&quot;         
##  [1073] &quot;daughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, and&quot;       
##  [1074] &quot;she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the&quot;        
##  [1075] &quot;world.  In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, as&quot;        
##  [1076] &quot;far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projecting&quot;         
##  [1077] &quot;weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance.  She was&quot;           
##  [1078] &quot;remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the&quot;       
##  [1079] &quot;advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by&quot;     
##  [1080] &quot;insinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind of&quot;           
##  [1081] &quot;discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to&quot;      
##  [1082] &quot;pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne&quot;          
##  [1083] &quot;Dashwood.  She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first evening&quot;      
##  [1084] &quot;of their being together, from his listening so attentively while she&quot;        
##  [1085] &quot;sang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons&#39; dining&quot;     
##  [1086] &quot;at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.&quot;     
##  [1087] &quot;It must be so.  She was perfectly convinced of it.  It would be an&quot;          
##  [1088] &quot;excellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE was handsome.  Mrs. Jennings&quot;      
##  [1089] &quot;had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her&quot;        
##  [1090] &quot;connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge; and she&quot;        
##  [1091] &quot;was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl.&quot;             
##  [1092] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1093] &quot;The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, for&quot;      
##  [1094] &quot;it supplied her with endless jokes against them both.  At the park she&quot;      
##  [1095] &quot;laughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne.  To the former&quot;      
##  [1096] &quot;her raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,&quot;              
##  [1097] &quot;perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at first&quot;                    
##  [1098] &quot;incomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knew&quot;       
##  [1099] &quot;whether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,&quot;        
##  [1100] &quot;for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel&#39;s&quot;           
##  [1101] &quot;advanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.&quot;            
##  [1102] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1103] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than&quot;            
##  [1104] &quot;herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of&quot;     
##  [1105] &quot;her daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability of&quot;       
##  [1106] &quot;wishing to throw ridicule on his age.&quot;                                       
##  [1107] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1108] &quot;\&quot;But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,&quot;      
##  [1109] &quot;though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured.  Colonel Brandon&quot;     
##  [1110] &quot;is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MY&quot;      
##  [1111] &quot;father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must have&quot;        
##  [1112] &quot;long outlived every sensation of the kind.  It is too ridiculous!  When&quot;     
##  [1113] &quot;is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not&quot;            
##  [1114] &quot;protect him?\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [1115] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1116] &quot;\&quot;Infirmity!\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;do you call Colonel Brandon infirm?  I can&quot;    
##  [1117] &quot;easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my&quot;       
##  [1118] &quot;mother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of&quot;     
##  [1119] &quot;his limbs!\&quot;&quot;                                                                
##  [1120] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1121] &quot;\&quot;Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?  and is not that the&quot;     
##  [1122] &quot;commonest infirmity of declining life?\&quot;&quot;                                    
##  [1123] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1124] &quot;\&quot;My dearest child,\&quot; said her mother, laughing, \&quot;at this rate you must&quot;    
##  [1125] &quot;be in continual terror of MY decay; and it must seem to you a miracle&quot;       
##  [1126] &quot;that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty.\&quot;&quot;              
##  [1127] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1128] &quot;\&quot;Mama, you are not doing me justice.  I know very well that Colonel&quot;        
##  [1129] &quot;Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of&quot;           
##  [1130] &quot;losing him in the course of nature.  He may live twenty years longer.&quot;       
##  [1131] &quot;But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony.\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [1132] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1133] &quot;\&quot;Perhaps,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;thirty-five and seventeen had better not have&quot;   
##  [1134] &quot;any thing to do with matrimony together.  But if there should by any&quot;        
##  [1135] &quot;chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I should&quot;     
##  [1136] &quot;not think Colonel Brandon&#39;s being thirty-five any objection to his&quot;          
##  [1137] &quot;marrying HER.\&quot;&quot;                                                             
##  [1138] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1139] &quot;\&quot;A woman of seven and twenty,\&quot; said Marianne, after pausing a moment,&quot;     
##  [1140] &quot;\&quot;can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be&quot;     
##  [1141] &quot;uncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might bring&quot;     
##  [1142] &quot;herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the&quot;            
##  [1143] &quot;provision and security of a wife.  In his marrying such a woman&quot;             
##  [1144] &quot;therefore there would be nothing unsuitable.  It would be a compact of&quot;      
##  [1145] &quot;convenience, and the world would be satisfied.  In my eyes it would be&quot;      
##  [1146] &quot;no marriage at all, but that would be nothing.  To me it would seem&quot;         
##  [1147] &quot;only a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at the&quot;     
##  [1148] &quot;expense of the other.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##  [1149] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1150] &quot;\&quot;It would be impossible, I know,\&quot; replied Elinor, \&quot;to convince you that&quot;  
##  [1151] &quot;a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five&quot;             
##  [1152] &quot;anything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.&quot;     
##  [1153] &quot;But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the&quot;       
##  [1154] &quot;constant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced to&quot;        
##  [1155] &quot;complain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in&quot;     
##  [1156] &quot;one of his shoulders.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##  [1157] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1158] &quot;\&quot;But he talked of flannel waistcoats,\&quot; said Marianne; \&quot;and with me a&quot;     
##  [1159] &quot;flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps,&quot;               
##  [1160] &quot;rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and&quot;      
##  [1161] &quot;the feeble.\&quot;&quot;                                                               
##  [1162] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1163] &quot;\&quot;Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him&quot;      
##  [1164] &quot;half so much.  Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to&quot;     
##  [1165] &quot;you in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?\&quot;&quot;         
##  [1166] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1167] &quot;Soon after this, upon Elinor&#39;s leaving the room, \&quot;Mama,\&quot; said&quot;             
##  [1168] &quot;Marianne, \&quot;I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot&quot;        
##  [1169] &quot;conceal from you.  I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well.  We have now&quot;       
##  [1170] &quot;been here almost a fortnight, and yet he does not come.  Nothing but&quot;        
##  [1171] &quot;real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.  What else&quot;      
##  [1172] &quot;can detain him at Norland?\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [1173] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1174] &quot;\&quot;Had you any idea of his coming so soon?\&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood.  \&quot;I had&quot;    
##  [1175] &quot;none.  On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the&quot;            
##  [1176] &quot;subject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of&quot;     
##  [1177] &quot;pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of his&quot;     
##  [1178] &quot;coming to Barton.  Does Elinor expect him already?\&quot;&quot;                        
##  [1179] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1180] &quot;\&quot;I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must.\&quot;&quot;               
##  [1181] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1182] &quot;\&quot;I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her&quot;            
##  [1183] &quot;yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she observed&quot;     
##  [1184] &quot;that there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that the&quot;     
##  [1185] &quot;room would be wanted for some time.\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [1186] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1187] &quot;\&quot;How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it!  But the whole of&quot;     
##  [1188] &quot;their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how&quot;         
##  [1189] &quot;composed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the&quot;         
##  [1190] &quot;last evening of their being together! In Edward&#39;s farewell there was no&quot;     
##  [1191] &quot;distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an&quot;             
##  [1192] &quot;affectionate brother to both.  Twice did I leave them purposely&quot;             
##  [1193] &quot;together in the course of the last morning, and each time did he most&quot;       
##  [1194] &quot;unaccountably follow me out of the room.  And Elinor, in quitting&quot;           
##  [1195] &quot;Norland and Edward, cried not as I did.  Even now her self-command is&quot;       
##  [1196] &quot;invariable.  When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try to&quot;       
##  [1197] &quot;avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?\&quot;&quot;                 
##  [1198] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1199] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1200] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1201] &quot;CHAPTER 9&quot;                                                                   
##  [1202] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1203] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1204] &quot;The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to&quot;          
##  [1205] &quot;themselves.  The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding&quot;     
##  [1206] &quot;them, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had&quot;         
##  [1207] &quot;given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater&quot;     
##  [1208] &quot;enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of their&quot;     
##  [1209] &quot;father.  Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the first&quot;     
##  [1210] &quot;fortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at&quot;        
##  [1211] &quot;home, could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.&quot;      
##  [1212] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1213] &quot;Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in&quot;       
##  [1214] &quot;spite of Sir John&#39;s urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the&quot;       
##  [1215] &quot;neighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at&quot;      
##  [1216] &quot;their service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s spirit overcame the&quot;      
##  [1217] &quot;wish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining to&quot;      
##  [1218] &quot;visit any family beyond the distance of a walk.  There were but few who&quot;     
##  [1219] &quot;could be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.&quot;       
##  [1220] &quot;About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding&quot;          
##  [1221] &quot;valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly&quot;           
##  [1222] &quot;described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered an&quot;     
##  [1223] &quot;ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a little&quot;       
##  [1224] &quot;of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to be&quot;           
##  [1225] &quot;better acquainted with it.  But they learnt, on enquiry, that its&quot;           
##  [1226] &quot;possessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately&quot;        
##  [1227] &quot;too infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.&quot;              
##  [1228] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1229] &quot;The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.  The high&quot;         
##  [1230] &quot;downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to&quot;         
##  [1231] &quot;seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy&quot;          
##  [1232] &quot;alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior&quot;     
##  [1233] &quot;beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one&quot;      
##  [1234] &quot;memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshine&quot;     
##  [1235] &quot;of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which the&quot;       
##  [1236] &quot;settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned.  The weather was&quot;     
##  [1237] &quot;not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their&quot;      
##  [1238] &quot;book, in spite of Marianne&#39;s declaration that the day would be&quot;              
##  [1239] &quot;lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off&quot;         
##  [1240] &quot;from their hills; and the two girls set off together.&quot;                       
##  [1241] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1242] &quot;They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at&quot;        
##  [1243] &quot;every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the&quot;          
##  [1244] &quot;animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears&quot;        
##  [1245] &quot;which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such&quot;               
##  [1246] &quot;delightful sensations.&quot;                                                      
##  [1247] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1248] &quot;\&quot;Is there a felicity in the world,\&quot; said Marianne, \&quot;superior to&quot;          
##  [1249] &quot;this?--Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours.\&quot;&quot;                    
##  [1250] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1251] &quot;Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting&quot;     
##  [1252] &quot;it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly&quot;     
##  [1253] &quot;the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in&quot;          
##  [1254] &quot;their face.-- Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though&quot;            
##  [1255] &quot;unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own&quot;         
##  [1256] &quot;house.  One consolation however remained for them, to which the&quot;             
##  [1257] &quot;exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety; it was that of&quot;       
##  [1258] &quot;running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which&quot;       
##  [1259] &quot;led immediately to their garden gate.&quot;                                       
##  [1260] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1261] &quot;They set off.  Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step&quot;        
##  [1262] &quot;brought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop&quot;            
##  [1263] &quot;herself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the&quot;     
##  [1264] &quot;bottom in safety.&quot;                                                           
##  [1265] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1266] &quot;A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was&quot;        
##  [1267] &quot;passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her&quot;            
##  [1268] &quot;accident happened.  He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.  She&quot;     
##  [1269] &quot;had raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in&quot;        
##  [1270] &quot;her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.  The gentleman offered&quot;        
##  [1271] &quot;his services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her&quot;             
##  [1272] &quot;situation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther&quot;       
##  [1273] &quot;delay, and carried her down the hill.  Then passing through the garden,&quot;     
##  [1274] &quot;the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly&quot;      
##  [1275] &quot;into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his&quot;      
##  [1276] &quot;hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.&quot;                      
##  [1277] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1278] &quot;Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while&quot;     
##  [1279] &quot;the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret&quot;      
##  [1280] &quot;admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized for&quot;      
##  [1281] &quot;his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so&quot;            
##  [1282] &quot;graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, received&quot;           
##  [1283] &quot;additional charms from his voice and expression.  Had he been even old,&quot;     
##  [1284] &quot;ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would&quot;         
##  [1285] &quot;have been secured by any act of attention to her child; but the&quot;             
##  [1286] &quot;influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to the&quot;           
##  [1287] &quot;action which came home to her feelings.&quot;                                     
##  [1288] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1289] &quot;She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address which&quot;     
##  [1290] &quot;always attended her, invited him to be seated.  But this he declined,&quot;       
##  [1291] &quot;as he was dirty and wet.  Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she&quot;     
##  [1292] &quot;was obliged.  His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present&quot;         
##  [1293] &quot;home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him the&quot;          
##  [1294] &quot;honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood.  The honour&quot;      
##  [1295] &quot;was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself still more&quot;       
##  [1296] &quot;interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain.&quot;                                  
##  [1297] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1298] &quot;His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the&quot;       
##  [1299] &quot;theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised&quot;       
##  [1300] &quot;against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior&quot;               
##  [1301] &quot;attractions.-- Marianne herself had seen less of his Mama the&quot;               
##  [1302] &quot;rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting&quot;       
##  [1303] &quot;her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their&quot;            
##  [1304] &quot;entering the house.  But she had seen enough of him to join in all the&quot;      
##  [1305] &quot;admiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her&quot;       
##  [1306] &quot;praise.  His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn&quot;     
##  [1307] &quot;for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the&quot;         
##  [1308] &quot;house with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of&quot;            
##  [1309] &quot;thought which particularly recommended the action to her.  Every&quot;            
##  [1310] &quot;circumstance belonging to him was interesting.  His name was good, his&quot;      
##  [1311] &quot;residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that&quot;       
##  [1312] &quot;of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.  Her&quot;          
##  [1313] &quot;imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a&quot;      
##  [1314] &quot;sprained ankle was disregarded.&quot;                                             
##  [1315] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1316] &quot;Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather&quot;        
##  [1317] &quot;that morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne&#39;s accident&quot;       
##  [1318] &quot;being related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any&quot;              
##  [1319] &quot;gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.&quot;                            
##  [1320] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1321] &quot;\&quot;Willoughby!\&quot; cried Sir John; \&quot;what, is HE in the country? That is good&quot;  
##  [1322] &quot;news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on&quot;           
##  [1323] &quot;Thursday.\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [1324] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1325] &quot;\&quot;You know him then,\&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood.&quot;                                  
##  [1326] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1327] &quot;\&quot;Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is down here every year.\&quot;&quot;            
##  [1328] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1329] &quot;\&quot;And what sort of a young man is he?\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [1330] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1331] &quot;\&quot;As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.  A very decent&quot;      
##  [1332] &quot;shot, and there is not a bolder rider in England.\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [1333] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1334] &quot;\&quot;And is that all you can say for him?\&quot; cried Marianne, indignantly.&quot;       
##  [1335] &quot;\&quot;But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his&quot;          
##  [1336] &quot;pursuits, his talents, and genius?\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [1337] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1338] &quot;Sir John was rather puzzled.&quot;                                                
##  [1339] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1340] &quot;\&quot;Upon my soul,\&quot; said he, \&quot;I do not know much about him as to all THAT.&quot;   
##  [1341] &quot;But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicest&quot;          
##  [1342] &quot;little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw.  Was she out with him&quot;           
##  [1343] &quot;today?\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
##  [1344] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1345] &quot;But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr.&quot;              
##  [1346] &quot;Willoughby&#39;s pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of his&quot;       
##  [1347] &quot;mind.&quot;                                                                       
##  [1348] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1349] &quot;\&quot;But who is he?\&quot; said Elinor.  \&quot;Where does he come from?  Has he a&quot;       
##  [1350] &quot;house at Allenham?\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##  [1351] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1352] &quot;On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he&quot;         
##  [1353] &quot;told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the&quot;             
##  [1354] &quot;country; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady&quot;      
##  [1355] &quot;at Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was&quot;     
##  [1356] &quot;to inherit; adding, \&quot;Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I can&quot;        
##  [1357] &quot;tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own in&quot;        
##  [1358] &quot;Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up to my&quot;     
##  [1359] &quot;younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.  Miss&quot;             
##  [1360] &quot;Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.  Brandon will&quot;      
##  [1361] &quot;be jealous, if she does not take care.\&quot;&quot;                                    
##  [1362] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1363] &quot;\&quot;I do not believe,\&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile,&quot;       
##  [1364] &quot;\&quot;that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY&quot;    
##  [1365] &quot;daughters towards what you call CATCHING him.  It is not an employment&quot;      
##  [1366] &quot;to which they have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us, let&quot;         
##  [1367] &quot;them be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however, from what you say,&quot;       
##  [1368] &quot;that he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will not&quot;     
##  [1369] &quot;be ineligible.\&quot;&quot;                                                            
##  [1370] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1371] &quot;\&quot;He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived,\&quot; repeated&quot;      
##  [1372] &quot;Sir John.  \&quot;I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he&quot;      
##  [1373] &quot;danced from eight o&#39;clock till four, without once sitting down.\&quot;&quot;           
##  [1374] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1375] &quot;\&quot;Did he indeed?\&quot; cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, \&quot;and with&quot;           
##  [1376] &quot;elegance, with spirit?\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [1377] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1378] &quot;\&quot;Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\&quot;&quot;                    
##  [1379] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1380] &quot;\&quot;That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be.  Whatever&quot;      
##  [1381] &quot;be his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, and&quot;       
##  [1382] &quot;leave him no sense of fatigue.\&quot;&quot;                                            
##  [1383] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1384] &quot;\&quot;Aye, aye, I see how it will be,\&quot; said Sir John, \&quot;I see how it will be.&quot;  
##  [1385] &quot;You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poor&quot;            
##  [1386] &quot;Brandon.\&quot;&quot;                                                                  
##  [1387] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1388] &quot;\&quot;That is an expression, Sir John,\&quot; said Marianne, warmly, \&quot;which I&quot;       
##  [1389] &quot;particularly dislike.  I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit&quot;       
##  [1390] &quot;is intended; and &#39;setting one&#39;s cap at a man,&#39; or &#39;making a conquest,&#39;&quot;      
##  [1391] &quot;are the most odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and&quot;     
##  [1392] &quot;if their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago&quot;        
##  [1393] &quot;destroyed all its ingenuity.\&quot;&quot;                                              
##  [1394] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1395] &quot;Sir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed as&quot;            
##  [1396] &quot;heartily as if he did, and then replied,&quot;                                    
##  [1397] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1398] &quot;\&quot;Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other.&quot;         
##  [1399] &quot;Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth&quot;        
##  [1400] &quot;setting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling&quot;          
##  [1401] &quot;about and spraining of ankles.\&quot;&quot;                                            
##  [1402] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1403] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1404] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1405] &quot;CHAPTER 10&quot;                                                                  
##  [1406] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1407] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1408] &quot;Marianne&#39;s preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,&quot;       
##  [1409] &quot;styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to make&quot;     
##  [1410] &quot;his personal enquiries.  He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more&quot;         
##  [1411] &quot;than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John&#39;s account of him and&quot;        
##  [1412] &quot;her own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the&quot;          
##  [1413] &quot;visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection,&quot;        
##  [1414] &quot;and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced&quot;      
##  [1415] &quot;him.  Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview&quot;       
##  [1416] &quot;to be convinced.&quot;                                                            
##  [1417] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1418] &quot;Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a&quot;            
##  [1419] &quot;remarkably pretty figure.  Marianne was still handsomer.  Her form,&quot;         
##  [1420] &quot;though not so correct as her sister&#39;s, in having the advantage of&quot;           
##  [1421] &quot;height, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in the&quot;     
##  [1422] &quot;common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was less&quot;      
##  [1423] &quot;violently outraged than usually happens.  Her skin was very brown, but,&quot;     
##  [1424] &quot;from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her&quot;         
##  [1425] &quot;features were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in her&quot;      
##  [1426] &quot;eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness,&quot;       
##  [1427] &quot;which could hardily be seen without delight.  From Willoughby their&quot;         
##  [1428] &quot;expression was at first held back, by the embarrassment which the&quot;           
##  [1429] &quot;remembrance of his assistance created.  But when this passed away, when&quot;     
##  [1430] &quot;her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the perfect&quot;              
##  [1431] &quot;good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness and vivacity, and&quot;       
##  [1432] &quot;above all, when she heard him declare, that of music and dancing he was&quot;     
##  [1433] &quot;passionately fond, she gave him such a look of approbation as secured&quot;       
##  [1434] &quot;the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay.&quot;     
##  [1435] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1436] &quot;It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her&quot;      
##  [1437] &quot;to talk.  She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and&quot;     
##  [1438] &quot;she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.  They speedily&quot;     
##  [1439] &quot;discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and&quot;        
##  [1440] &quot;that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related&quot;     
##  [1441] &quot;to either.  Encouraged by this to a further examination of his&quot;              
##  [1442] &quot;opinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; her&quot;        
##  [1443] &quot;favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous&quot;     
##  [1444] &quot;a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have been&quot;             
##  [1445] &quot;insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellence&quot;     
##  [1446] &quot;of such works, however disregarded before.  Their taste was strikingly&quot;      
##  [1447] &quot;alike.  The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--or if&quot;      
##  [1448] &quot;any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer than&quot;      
##  [1449] &quot;till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be&quot;     
##  [1450] &quot;displayed.  He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her&quot;              
##  [1451] &quot;enthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they conversed with&quot;        
##  [1452] &quot;the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.&quot;                         
##  [1453] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1454] &quot;\&quot;Well, Marianne,\&quot; said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, \&quot;for ONE&quot;     
##  [1455] &quot;morning I think you have done pretty well.  You have already&quot;                
##  [1456] &quot;ascertained Mr. Willoughby&#39;s opinion in almost every matter of&quot;              
##  [1457] &quot;importance.  You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are&quot;           
##  [1458] &quot;certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have&quot;          
##  [1459] &quot;received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.&quot;       
##  [1460] &quot;But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such&quot;               
##  [1461] &quot;extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?  You will soon&quot;       
##  [1462] &quot;have exhausted each favourite topic.  Another meeting will suffice to&quot;       
##  [1463] &quot;explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and&quot;     
##  [1464] &quot;then you can have nothing farther to ask.\&quot;--&quot;                               
##  [1465] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1466] &quot;\&quot;Elinor,\&quot; cried Marianne, \&quot;is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so&quot;   
##  [1467] &quot;scanty?  But I see what you mean.  I have been too much at my ease, too&quot;     
##  [1468] &quot;happy, too frank.  I have erred against every common-place notion of&quot;        
##  [1469] &quot;decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been&quot;            
##  [1470] &quot;reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had I talked only of the&quot;         
##  [1471] &quot;weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this&quot;      
##  [1472] &quot;reproach would have been spared.\&quot;&quot;                                          
##  [1473] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1474] &quot;\&quot;My love,\&quot; said her mother, \&quot;you must not be offended with Elinor--she&quot;   
##  [1475] &quot;was only in jest.  I should scold her myself, if she were capable of&quot;        
##  [1476] &quot;wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new&quot;              
##  [1477] &quot;friend.\&quot;-- Marianne was softened in a moment.&quot;                              
##  [1478] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1479] &quot;Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their&quot;          
##  [1480] &quot;acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer.  He&quot;        
##  [1481] &quot;came to them every day.  To enquire after Marianne was at first his&quot;         
##  [1482] &quot;excuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave&quot;     
##  [1483] &quot;greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased&quot;      
##  [1484] &quot;to be possible, by Marianne&#39;s perfect recovery.  She was confined for&quot;       
##  [1485] &quot;some days to the house; but never had any confinement been less&quot;             
##  [1486] &quot;irksome.  Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick&quot;               
##  [1487] &quot;imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners.  He was&quot;        
##  [1488] &quot;exactly formed to engage Marianne&#39;s heart, for with all this, he joined&quot;     
##  [1489] &quot;not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was&quot;       
##  [1490] &quot;now roused and increased by the example of her own, and which&quot;               
##  [1491] &quot;recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.&quot;                   
##  [1492] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1493] &quot;His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.  They read,&quot;      
##  [1494] &quot;they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were considerable;&quot;     
##  [1495] &quot;and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had&quot;            
##  [1496] &quot;unfortunately wanted.&quot;                                                       
##  [1497] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1498] &quot;In Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne&#39;s; and&quot;     
##  [1499] &quot;Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he&quot;          
##  [1500] &quot;strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too&quot;       
##  [1501] &quot;much what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons or&quot;     
##  [1502] &quot;circumstances.  In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other&quot;          
##  [1503] &quot;people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided&quot;     
##  [1504] &quot;attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily the&quot;      
##  [1505] &quot;forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution which Elinor&quot;     
##  [1506] &quot;could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in&quot;        
##  [1507] &quot;its support.&quot;                                                                
##  [1508] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1509] &quot;Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized&quot;        
##  [1510] &quot;her at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her&quot;       
##  [1511] &quot;ideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable.  Willoughby was&quot;       
##  [1512] &quot;all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every&quot;         
##  [1513] &quot;brighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour&quot;             
##  [1514] &quot;declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities&quot;      
##  [1515] &quot;were strong.&quot;                                                                
##  [1516] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1517] &quot;Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their&quot;          
##  [1518] &quot;marriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before the&quot;     
##  [1519] &quot;end of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate&quot;           
##  [1520] &quot;herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.&quot;     
##  [1521] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1522] &quot;Colonel Brandon&#39;s partiality for Marianne, which had so early been&quot;          
##  [1523] &quot;discovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, when&quot;     
##  [1524] &quot;it ceased to be noticed by them.  Their attention and wit were drawn&quot;        
##  [1525] &quot;off to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other had&quot;       
##  [1526] &quot;incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his feelings&quot;         
##  [1527] &quot;began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility.&quot;     
##  [1528] &quot;Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments&quot;      
##  [1529] &quot;which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction, were now&quot;     
##  [1530] &quot;actually excited by her sister; and that however a general resemblance&quot;      
##  [1531] &quot;of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr.&quot;       
##  [1532] &quot;Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was no&quot;              
##  [1533] &quot;hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon.  She saw it with concern;&quot;       
##  [1534] &quot;for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a&quot;      
##  [1535] &quot;very lively one of five and twenty? and as she could not even wish him&quot;      
##  [1536] &quot;successful, she heartily wished him indifferent.  She liked him--in&quot;         
##  [1537] &quot;spite of his gravity and reserve, she beheld in him an object of&quot;            
##  [1538] &quot;interest.  His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve&quot;          
##  [1539] &quot;appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any&quot;        
##  [1540] &quot;natural gloominess of temper.  Sir John had dropped hints of past&quot;           
##  [1541] &quot;injuries and disappointments, which justified her belief of his being&quot;       
##  [1542] &quot;an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and compassion.&quot;       
##  [1543] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1544] &quot;Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by&quot;     
##  [1545] &quot;Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being neither&quot;      
##  [1546] &quot;lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.&quot;                 
##  [1547] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1548] &quot;\&quot;Brandon is just the kind of man,\&quot; said Willoughby one day, when they&quot;     
##  [1549] &quot;were talking of him together, \&quot;whom every body speaks well of, and&quot;         
##  [1550] &quot;nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers&quot;     
##  [1551] &quot;to talk to.\&quot;&quot;                                                               
##  [1552] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1553] &quot;\&quot;That is exactly what I think of him,\&quot; cried Marianne.&quot;                    
##  [1554] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1555] &quot;\&quot;Do not boast of it, however,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;for it is injustice in&quot;      
##  [1556] &quot;both of you.  He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and&quot;      
##  [1557] &quot;I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him.\&quot;&quot;         
##  [1558] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1559] &quot;\&quot;That he is patronised by YOU,\&quot; replied Willoughby, \&quot;is certainly in&quot;     
##  [1560] &quot;his favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in&quot;        
##  [1561] &quot;itself.  Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a&quot;      
##  [1562] &quot;woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command the&quot;           
##  [1563] &quot;indifference of any body else?\&quot;&quot;                                            
##  [1564] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1565] &quot;\&quot;But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will&quot;        
##  [1566] &quot;make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother.  If their&quot;      
##  [1567] &quot;praise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more&quot;        
##  [1568] &quot;undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust.\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [1569] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1570] &quot;\&quot;In defence of your protege you can even be saucy.\&quot;&quot;                       
##  [1571] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1572] &quot;\&quot;My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will always&quot;     
##  [1573] &quot;have attractions for me.  Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty&quot;       
##  [1574] &quot;and forty.  He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad, has&quot;     
##  [1575] &quot;read, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him capable of giving me&quot;       
##  [1576] &quot;much information on various subjects; and he has always answered my&quot;         
##  [1577] &quot;inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature.\&quot;&quot;                
##  [1578] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1579] &quot;\&quot;That is to say,\&quot; cried Marianne contemptuously, \&quot;he has told you, that&quot;  
##  [1580] &quot;in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are&quot;               
##  [1581] &quot;troublesome.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [1582] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1583] &quot;\&quot;He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such inquiries,&quot;     
##  [1584] &quot;but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed.\&quot;&quot;   
##  [1585] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1586] &quot;\&quot;Perhaps,\&quot; said Willoughby, \&quot;his observations may have extended to the&quot;   
##  [1587] &quot;existence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins.\&quot;&quot;                          
##  [1588] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1589] &quot;\&quot;I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further&quot;    
##  [1590] &quot;than your candour.  But why should you dislike him?\&quot;&quot;                       
##  [1591] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1592] &quot;\&quot;I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary, as a very&quot;         
##  [1593] &quot;respectable man, who has every body&#39;s good word, and nobody&#39;s notice;&quot;       
##  [1594] &quot;who, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to&quot;       
##  [1595] &quot;employ, and two new coats every year.\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [1596] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1597] &quot;\&quot;Add to which,\&quot; cried Marianne, \&quot;that he has neither genius, taste, nor&quot;  
##  [1598] &quot;spirit.  That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no&quot;          
##  [1599] &quot;ardour, and his voice no expression.\&quot;&quot;                                      
##  [1600] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1601] &quot;\&quot;You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,\&quot; replied Elinor,&quot;    
##  [1602] &quot;\&quot;and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the&quot;             
##  [1603] &quot;commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and&quot;             
##  [1604] &quot;insipid.  I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred,&quot;         
##  [1605] &quot;well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable&quot;     
##  [1606] &quot;heart.\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
##  [1607] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1608] &quot;\&quot;Miss Dashwood,\&quot; cried Willoughby, \&quot;you are now using me unkindly.  You&quot;  
##  [1609] &quot;are endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my&quot;      
##  [1610] &quot;will.  But it will not do.  You shall find me as stubborn as you can be&quot;     
##  [1611] &quot;artful.  I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel&quot;            
##  [1612] &quot;Brandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he has&quot;     
##  [1613] &quot;found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade him&quot;      
##  [1614] &quot;to buy my brown mare.  If it will be any satisfaction to you, however,&quot;      
##  [1615] &quot;to be told, that I believe his character to be in other respects&quot;            
##  [1616] &quot;irreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return for an&quot;             
##  [1617] &quot;acknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me the&quot;        
##  [1618] &quot;privilege of disliking him as much as ever.\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [1619] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1620] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1621] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1622] &quot;CHAPTER 11&quot;                                                                  
##  [1623] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1624] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1625] &quot;Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came&quot;     
##  [1626] &quot;into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy their&quot;       
##  [1627] &quot;time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have such&quot;         
##  [1628] &quot;frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little&quot;     
##  [1629] &quot;leisure for serious employment.  Yet such was the case.  When Marianne&quot;      
##  [1630] &quot;was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which Sir&quot;       
##  [1631] &quot;John had been previously forming, were put into execution.  The private&quot;     
##  [1632] &quot;balls at the park then began; and parties on the water were made and&quot;        
##  [1633] &quot;accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.  In every&quot;           
##  [1634] &quot;meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and&quot;               
##  [1635] &quot;familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly&quot;             
##  [1636] &quot;calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the&quot;         
##  [1637] &quot;Dashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of&quot;      
##  [1638] &quot;Marianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,&quot;      
##  [1639] &quot;in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her&quot;              
##  [1640] &quot;affection.&quot;                                                                  
##  [1641] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1642] &quot;Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment.  She only wished&quot;         
##  [1643] &quot;that it were less openly shewn; and once or twice did venture to&quot;            
##  [1644] &quot;suggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne.  But Marianne&quot;       
##  [1645] &quot;abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;&quot;     
##  [1646] &quot;and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves&quot;      
##  [1647] &quot;illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but a&quot;         
##  [1648] &quot;disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.&quot;      
##  [1649] &quot;Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was an&quot;       
##  [1650] &quot;illustration of their opinions.&quot;                                             
##  [1651] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1652] &quot;When he was present she had no eyes for any one else.  Every thing he&quot;       
##  [1653] &quot;did, was right.  Every thing he said, was clever.  If their evenings at&quot;     
##  [1654] &quot;the park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the rest&quot;     
##  [1655] &quot;of the party to get her a good hand.  If dancing formed the amusement&quot;       
##  [1656] &quot;of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged to&quot;     
##  [1657] &quot;separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and&quot;         
##  [1658] &quot;scarcely spoke a word to any body else.  Such conduct made them of&quot;          
##  [1659] &quot;course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and&quot;       
##  [1660] &quot;seemed hardly to provoke them.&quot;                                              
##  [1661] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1662] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left&quot;      
##  [1663] &quot;her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them.  To her&quot;     
##  [1664] &quot;it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and&quot;     
##  [1665] &quot;ardent mind.&quot;                                                                
##  [1666] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1667] &quot;This was the season of happiness to Marianne.  Her heart was devoted to&quot;     
##  [1668] &quot;Willoughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with&quot;      
##  [1669] &quot;her from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought it&quot;     
##  [1670] &quot;possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her&quot;            
##  [1671] &quot;present home.&quot;                                                               
##  [1672] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1673] &quot;Elinor&#39;s happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not so much at&quot;          
##  [1674] &quot;ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure.  They afforded&quot;      
##  [1675] &quot;her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind,&quot;       
##  [1676] &quot;nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than&quot;          
##  [1677] &quot;ever.  Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the&quot;     
##  [1678] &quot;conversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker,&quot;     
##  [1679] &quot;and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a&quot;     
##  [1680] &quot;large share of her discourse.  She had already repeated her own history&quot;     
##  [1681] &quot;to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor&#39;s memory been equal to&quot;        
##  [1682] &quot;her means of improvement, she might have known very early in their&quot;          
##  [1683] &quot;acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings&#39;s last illness, and&quot;        
##  [1684] &quot;what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died.  Lady Middleton&quot;      
##  [1685] &quot;was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent.  Elinor&quot;       
##  [1686] &quot;needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere&quot;           
##  [1687] &quot;calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do.  Towards her&quot;         
##  [1688] &quot;husband and mother she was the same as to them; and intimacy was&quot;            
##  [1689] &quot;therefore neither to be looked for nor desired.  She had nothing to say&quot;     
##  [1690] &quot;one day that she had not said the day before.  Her insipidity was&quot;           
##  [1691] &quot;invariable, for even her spirits were always the same; and though she&quot;       
##  [1692] &quot;did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband, provided every&quot;          
##  [1693] &quot;thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her,&quot;     
##  [1694] &quot;she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might&quot;       
##  [1695] &quot;have experienced in sitting at home;--and so little did her presence&quot;        
##  [1696] &quot;add to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation,&quot;      
##  [1697] &quot;that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her&quot;     
##  [1698] &quot;solicitude about her troublesome boys.&quot;                                      
##  [1699] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1700] &quot;In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find&quot;      
##  [1701] &quot;a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite&quot;     
##  [1702] &quot;the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.&quot;                
##  [1703] &quot;Willoughby was out of the question.  Her admiration and regard, even&quot;        
##  [1704] &quot;her sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his&quot;               
##  [1705] &quot;attentions were wholly Marianne&#39;s, and a far less agreeable man might&quot;       
##  [1706] &quot;have been more generally pleasing.  Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for&quot;      
##  [1707] &quot;himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in&quot;        
##  [1708] &quot;conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the&quot;            
##  [1709] &quot;indifference of her sister.&quot;                                                 
##  [1710] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1711] &quot;Elinor&#39;s compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect&quot;         
##  [1712] &quot;that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.&quot;         
##  [1713] &quot;This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from&quot;      
##  [1714] &quot;him one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by&quot;        
##  [1715] &quot;mutual consent, while the others were dancing.  His eyes were fixed on&quot;      
##  [1716] &quot;Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint&quot;       
##  [1717] &quot;smile, \&quot;Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second&quot;              
##  [1718] &quot;attachments.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [1719] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1720] &quot;\&quot;No,\&quot; replied Elinor, \&quot;her opinions are all romantic.\&quot;&quot;                  
##  [1721] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1722] &quot;\&quot;Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist.\&quot;&quot;        
##  [1723] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1724] &quot;\&quot;I believe she does.  But how she contrives it without reflecting on&quot;       
##  [1725] &quot;the character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not.&quot;     
##  [1726] &quot;A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of&quot;     
##  [1727] &quot;common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to define&quot;      
##  [1728] &quot;and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.\&quot;&quot;                
##  [1729] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1730] &quot;\&quot;This will probably be the case,\&quot; he replied; \&quot;and yet there is&quot;          
##  [1731] &quot;something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is&quot;         
##  [1732] &quot;sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions.\&quot;&quot;     
##  [1733] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1734] &quot;\&quot;I cannot agree with you there,\&quot; said Elinor.  \&quot;There are&quot;                
##  [1735] &quot;inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne&#39;s, which all the&quot;         
##  [1736] &quot;charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Her&quot;      
##  [1737] &quot;systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at&quot;           
##  [1738] &quot;nought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward&quot;     
##  [1739] &quot;to as her greatest possible advantage.\&quot;&quot;                                    
##  [1740] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1741] &quot;After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,--&quot;                
##  [1742] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1743] &quot;\&quot;Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a&quot;          
##  [1744] &quot;second attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body?  Are those&quot;      
##  [1745] &quot;who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the&quot;          
##  [1746] &quot;inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be&quot;      
##  [1747] &quot;equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?\&quot;&quot;                       
##  [1748] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1749] &quot;\&quot;Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles.&quot;    
##  [1750] &quot;I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second&quot;       
##  [1751] &quot;attachment&#39;s being pardonable.\&quot;&quot;                                            
##  [1752] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1753] &quot;\&quot;This,\&quot; said he, \&quot;cannot hold; but a change, a total change of&quot;           
##  [1754] &quot;sentiments--No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements&quot;     
##  [1755] &quot;of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they&quot;            
##  [1756] &quot;succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous!  I&quot;     
##  [1757] &quot;speak from experience.  I once knew a lady who in temper and mind&quot;           
##  [1758] &quot;greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her, but who&quot;     
##  [1759] &quot;from an inforced change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances\&quot;--&quot;     
##  [1760] &quot;Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said too much,&quot;        
##  [1761] &quot;and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might not&quot;            
##  [1762] &quot;otherwise have entered Elinor&#39;s head.  The lady would probably have&quot;         
##  [1763] &quot;passed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what&quot;      
##  [1764] &quot;concerned her ought not to escape his lips.  As it was, it required but&quot;     
##  [1765] &quot;a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender&quot;             
##  [1766] &quot;recollection of past regard.  Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne,&quot;      
##  [1767] &quot;in her place, would not have done so little.  The whole story would&quot;         
##  [1768] &quot;have been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing&quot;     
##  [1769] &quot;established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.&quot;                
##  [1770] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1771] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1772] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1773] &quot;CHAPTER 12&quot;                                                                  
##  [1774] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1775] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1776] &quot;As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the&quot;           
##  [1777] &quot;latter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of&quot;        
##  [1778] &quot;all that she knew before of Marianne&#39;s imprudence and want of thought,&quot;      
##  [1779] &quot;surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.  Marianne told her,&quot;     
##  [1780] &quot;with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one&quot;       
##  [1781] &quot;that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was&quot;      
##  [1782] &quot;exactly calculated to carry a woman.  Without considering that it was&quot;       
##  [1783] &quot;not in her mother&#39;s plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter&quot;       
##  [1784] &quot;her resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the&quot;         
##  [1785] &quot;servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable&quot;       
##  [1786] &quot;to receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, and&quot;       
##  [1787] &quot;told her sister of it in raptures.&quot;                                          
##  [1788] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1789] &quot;\&quot;He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,\&quot;&quot;     
##  [1790] &quot;she added, \&quot;and when it arrives we will ride every day.  You shall&quot;         
##  [1791] &quot;share its use with me.  Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the&quot;            
##  [1792] &quot;delight of a gallop on some of these downs.\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [1793] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1794] &quot;Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to&quot;           
##  [1795] &quot;comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for&quot;        
##  [1796] &quot;some time she refused to submit to them.  As to an additional servant,&quot;      
##  [1797] &quot;the expense would be a trifle; Mama she was sure would never object to&quot;      
##  [1798] &quot;it; and any horse would do for HIM; he might always get one at the&quot;          
##  [1799] &quot;park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.  Elinor then&quot;     
##  [1800] &quot;ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a&quot;      
##  [1801] &quot;man so little, or at least so lately known to her.  This was too much.&quot;      
##  [1802] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1803] &quot;\&quot;You are mistaken, Elinor,\&quot; said she warmly, \&quot;in supposing I know very&quot;   
##  [1804] &quot;little of Willoughby.  I have not known him long indeed, but I am much&quot;      
##  [1805] &quot;better acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in the&quot;        
##  [1806] &quot;world, except yourself and mama.  It is not time or opportunity that is&quot;     
##  [1807] &quot;to determine intimacy;--it is disposition alone.  Seven years would be&quot;      
##  [1808] &quot;insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven&quot;      
##  [1809] &quot;days are more than enough for others.  I should hold myself guilty of&quot;       
##  [1810] &quot;greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from&quot;         
##  [1811] &quot;Willoughby.  Of John I know very little, though we have lived together&quot;      
##  [1812] &quot;for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.\&quot;&quot;            
##  [1813] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1814] &quot;Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.  She knew her&quot;         
##  [1815] &quot;sister&#39;s temper.  Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach&quot;       
##  [1816] &quot;her the more to her own opinion.  But by an appeal to her affection for&quot;     
##  [1817] &quot;her mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent&quot;         
##  [1818] &quot;mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she&quot;         
##  [1819] &quot;consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly&quot;           
##  [1820] &quot;subdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent&quot;         
##  [1821] &quot;kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw&quot;       
##  [1822] &quot;him next, that it must be declined.&quot;                                         
##  [1823] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1824] &quot;She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the&quot;             
##  [1825] &quot;cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to&quot;       
##  [1826] &quot;him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his&quot;        
##  [1827] &quot;present.  The reasons for this alteration were at the same time&quot;             
##  [1828] &quot;related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side&quot;         
##  [1829] &quot;impossible.  His concern however was very apparent; and after&quot;               
##  [1830] &quot;expressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice,--\&quot;But,&quot;    
##  [1831] &quot;Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now.  I&quot;        
##  [1832] &quot;shall keep it only till you can claim it.  When you leave Barton to&quot;         
##  [1833] &quot;form your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall&quot;         
##  [1834] &quot;receive you.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [1835] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1836] &quot;This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the&quot;            
##  [1837] &quot;sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her&quot;        
##  [1838] &quot;sister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so&quot;        
##  [1839] &quot;decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between&quot;         
##  [1840] &quot;them.  From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each&quot;      
##  [1841] &quot;other; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, or&quot;     
##  [1842] &quot;any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discover&quot;       
##  [1843] &quot;it by accident.&quot;                                                             
##  [1844] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1845] &quot;Margaret related something to her the next day, which placed this&quot;           
##  [1846] &quot;matter in a still clearer light.  Willoughby had spent the preceding&quot;        
##  [1847] &quot;evening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour&quot;     
##  [1848] &quot;with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations,&quot;           
##  [1849] &quot;which, with a most important face, she communicated to her eldest&quot;           
##  [1850] &quot;sister, when they were next by themselves.&quot;                                  
##  [1851] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1852] &quot;\&quot;Oh, Elinor!\&quot; she cried, \&quot;I have such a secret to tell you about&quot;         
##  [1853] &quot;Marianne.  I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.\&quot;&quot;     
##  [1854] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1855] &quot;\&quot;You have said so,\&quot; replied Elinor, \&quot;almost every day since they first&quot;   
##  [1856] &quot;met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I&quot;        
##  [1857] &quot;believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round&quot;       
##  [1858] &quot;her neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great&quot;           
##  [1859] &quot;uncle.\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
##  [1860] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1861] &quot;\&quot;But indeed this is quite another thing.  I am sure they will be&quot;           
##  [1862] &quot;married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.\&quot;&quot;                     
##  [1863] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1864] &quot;\&quot;Take care, Margaret.  It may be only the hair of some great uncle of&quot;      
##  [1865] &quot;HIS.\&quot;&quot;                                                                      
##  [1866] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1867] &quot;\&quot;But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne&#39;s. I am almost sure it is, for I&quot;      
##  [1868] &quot;saw him cut it off.  Last night after tea, when you and mama went out&quot;       
##  [1869] &quot;of the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could&quot;     
##  [1870] &quot;be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he took&quot;     
##  [1871] &quot;up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was all&quot;         
##  [1872] &quot;tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of&quot;     
##  [1873] &quot;white paper; and put it into his pocket-book.\&quot;&quot;                             
##  [1874] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1875] &quot;For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not&quot;            
##  [1876] &quot;withhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance&quot;       
##  [1877] &quot;was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.&quot;             
##  [1878] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1879] &quot;Margaret&#39;s sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory&quot;       
##  [1880] &quot;to her sister.  When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the&quot;          
##  [1881] &quot;park, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor&#39;s particular&quot;         
##  [1882] &quot;favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,&quot;          
##  [1883] &quot;Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, \&quot;I must not&quot;        
##  [1884] &quot;tell, may I, Elinor?\&quot;&quot;                                                      
##  [1885] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1886] &quot;This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.&quot;        
##  [1887] &quot;But the effort was painful.  She was convinced that Margaret had fixed&quot;      
##  [1888] &quot;on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a&quot;        
##  [1889] &quot;standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.&quot;                                           
##  [1890] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1891] &quot;Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than good&quot;       
##  [1892] &quot;to the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to&quot;          
##  [1893] &quot;Margaret,&quot;                                                                   
##  [1894] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1895] &quot;\&quot;Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to&quot;      
##  [1896] &quot;repeat them.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [1897] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1898] &quot;\&quot;I never had any conjectures about it,\&quot; replied Margaret; \&quot;it was you&quot;    
##  [1899] &quot;who told me of it yourself.\&quot;&quot;                                               
##  [1900] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1901] &quot;This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly&quot;           
##  [1902] &quot;pressed to say something more.&quot;                                              
##  [1903] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1904] &quot;\&quot;Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,\&quot; said Mrs.&quot;            
##  [1905] &quot;Jennings.  \&quot;What is the gentleman&#39;s name?\&quot;&quot;                                
##  [1906] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1907] &quot;\&quot;I must not tell, ma&#39;am. But I know very well what it is; and I know&quot;       
##  [1908] &quot;where he is too.\&quot;&quot;                                                          
##  [1909] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1910] &quot;\&quot;Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to be&quot;     
##  [1911] &quot;sure.  He is the curate of the parish I dare say.\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [1912] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1913] &quot;\&quot;No, THAT he is not.  He is of no profession at all.\&quot;&quot;                     
##  [1914] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1915] &quot;\&quot;Margaret,\&quot; said Marianne with great warmth, \&quot;you know that all this is&quot;  
##  [1916] &quot;an invention of your own, and that there is no such person in&quot;               
##  [1917] &quot;existence.\&quot;&quot;                                                                
##  [1918] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1919] &quot;\&quot;Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such&quot;     
##  [1920] &quot;a man once, and his name begins with an F.\&quot;&quot;                                
##  [1921] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1922] &quot;Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this&quot;      
##  [1923] &quot;moment, \&quot;that it rained very hard,\&quot; though she believed the&quot;               
##  [1924] &quot;interruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her&quot;       
##  [1925] &quot;ladyship&#39;s great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as&quot;      
##  [1926] &quot;delighted her husband and mother.  The idea however started by her, was&quot;     
##  [1927] &quot;immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion&quot;           
##  [1928] &quot;mindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of&quot;      
##  [1929] &quot;rain by both of them.  Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked&quot;         
##  [1930] &quot;Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of&quot;       
##  [1931] &quot;different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.  But not so&quot;      
##  [1932] &quot;easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her.&quot;      
##  [1933] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1934] &quot;A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a&quot;     
##  [1935] &quot;very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a&quot;              
##  [1936] &quot;brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not&quot;      
##  [1937] &quot;be seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orders&quot;     
##  [1938] &quot;on that head.  The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, and&quot;        
##  [1939] &quot;Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowed&quot;       
##  [1940] &quot;to be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, at&quot;        
##  [1941] &quot;least, twice every summer for the last ten years.  They contained a&quot;         
##  [1942] &quot;noble piece of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the&quot;     
##  [1943] &quot;morning&#39;s amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriages&quot;       
##  [1944] &quot;only to be employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of a&quot;      
##  [1945] &quot;complete party of pleasure.&quot;                                                 
##  [1946] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1947] &quot;To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,&quot;           
##  [1948] &quot;considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the&quot;      
##  [1949] &quot;last fortnight;--and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was&quot;             
##  [1950] &quot;persuaded by Elinor to stay at home.&quot;                                        
##  [1951] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1952] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1953] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1954] &quot;CHAPTER 13&quot;                                                                  
##  [1955] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1956] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1957] &quot;Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from&quot;         
##  [1958] &quot;what Elinor had expected.  She was prepared to be wet through,&quot;              
##  [1959] &quot;fatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, for&quot;     
##  [1960] &quot;they did not go at all.&quot;                                                     
##  [1961] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1962] &quot;By ten o&#39;clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they&quot;        
##  [1963] &quot;were to breakfast.  The morning was rather favourable, though it had&quot;        
##  [1964] &quot;rained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,&quot;        
##  [1965] &quot;and the sun frequently appeared.  They were all in high spirits and&quot;         
##  [1966] &quot;good humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the&quot;             
##  [1967] &quot;greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.&quot;             
##  [1968] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1969] &quot;While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in.  Among the&quot;        
##  [1970] &quot;rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he took it, looked at the&quot;          
##  [1971] &quot;direction, changed colour, and immediately left the room.&quot;                   
##  [1972] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1973] &quot;\&quot;What is the matter with Brandon?\&quot; said Sir John.&quot;                         
##  [1974] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1975] &quot;Nobody could tell.&quot;                                                          
##  [1976] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1977] &quot;\&quot;I hope he has had no bad news,\&quot; said Lady Middleton.  \&quot;It must be&quot;       
##  [1978] &quot;something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my&quot;            
##  [1979] &quot;breakfast table so suddenly.\&quot;&quot;                                              
##  [1980] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1981] &quot;In about five minutes he returned.&quot;                                          
##  [1982] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1983] &quot;\&quot;No bad news, Colonel, I hope;\&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as he&quot;         
##  [1984] &quot;entered the room.&quot;                                                           
##  [1985] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1986] &quot;\&quot;None at all, ma&#39;am, I thank you.\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [1987] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1988] &quot;\&quot;Was it from Avignon?  I hope it is not to say that your sister is&quot;         
##  [1989] &quot;worse.\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
##  [1990] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1991] &quot;\&quot;No, ma&#39;am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business.\&quot;&quot;       
##  [1992] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1993] &quot;\&quot;But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a&quot;         
##  [1994] &quot;letter of business?  Come, come, this won&#39;t do, Colonel; so let us hear&quot;     
##  [1995] &quot;the truth of it.\&quot;&quot;                                                          
##  [1996] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1997] &quot;\&quot;My dear madam,\&quot; said Lady Middleton, \&quot;recollect what you are saying.\&quot;&quot;  
##  [1998] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [1999] &quot;\&quot;Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?\&quot; said&quot;       
##  [2000] &quot;Mrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter&#39;s reproof.&quot;                 
##  [2001] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2002] &quot;\&quot;No, indeed, it is not.\&quot;&quot;                                                  
##  [2003] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2004] &quot;\&quot;Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel.  And I hope she is well.\&quot;&quot;    
##  [2005] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2006] &quot;\&quot;Whom do you mean, ma&#39;am?\&quot; said he, colouring a little.&quot;                   
##  [2007] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2008] &quot;\&quot;Oh! you know who I mean.\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [2009] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2010] &quot;\&quot;I am particularly sorry, ma&#39;am,\&quot; said he, addressing Lady Middleton,&quot;     
##  [2011] &quot;\&quot;that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which&quot;      
##  [2012] &quot;requires my immediate attendance in town.\&quot;&quot;                                 
##  [2013] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2014] &quot;\&quot;In town!\&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings.  \&quot;What can you have to do in town at&quot;     
##  [2015] &quot;this time of year?\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##  [2016] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2017] &quot;\&quot;My own loss is great,\&quot; he continued, \&quot;in being obliged to leave so&quot;      
##  [2018] &quot;agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence&quot;       
##  [2019] &quot;is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell.\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [2020] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2021] &quot;What a blow upon them all was this!&quot;                                         
##  [2022] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2023] &quot;\&quot;But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon,\&quot; said&quot;           
##  [2024] &quot;Marianne, eagerly, \&quot;will it not be sufficient?\&quot;&quot;                           
##  [2025] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2026] &quot;He shook his head.&quot;                                                          
##  [2027] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2028] &quot;\&quot;We must go,\&quot; said Sir John.--\&quot;It shall not be put off when we are so&quot;    
##  [2029] &quot;near it.  You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all.\&quot;&quot;      
##  [2030] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2031] &quot;\&quot;I wish it could be so easily settled.  But it is not in my power to&quot;       
##  [2032] &quot;delay my journey for one day!\&quot;&quot;                                             
##  [2033] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2034] &quot;\&quot;If you would but let us know what your business is,\&quot; said Mrs.&quot;           
##  [2035] &quot;Jennings, \&quot;we might see whether it could be put off or not.\&quot;&quot;              
##  [2036] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2037] &quot;\&quot;You would not be six hours later,\&quot; said Willoughby, \&quot;if you were to&quot;     
##  [2038] &quot;defer your journey till our return.\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [2039] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2040] &quot;\&quot;I cannot afford to lose ONE hour.\&quot;--&quot;                                     
##  [2041] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2042] &quot;Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, \&quot;There&quot;       
##  [2043] &quot;are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.  Brandon is one of&quot;     
##  [2044] &quot;them.  He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this&quot;         
##  [2045] &quot;trick for getting out of it.  I would lay fifty guineas the letter was&quot;      
##  [2046] &quot;of his own writing.\&quot;&quot;                                                       
##  [2047] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2048] &quot;\&quot;I have no doubt of it,\&quot; replied Marianne.&quot;                                
##  [2049] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2050] &quot;\&quot;There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of&quot;        
##  [2051] &quot;old,\&quot; said Sir John, \&quot;when once you are determined on anything.  But,&quot;     
##  [2052] &quot;however, I hope you will think better of it.  Consider, here are the&quot;        
##  [2053] &quot;two Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked&quot;      
##  [2054] &quot;up from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his&quot;         
##  [2055] &quot;usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell.\&quot;&quot;                                 
##  [2056] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2057] &quot;Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of&quot;             
##  [2058] &quot;disappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to be&quot;             
##  [2059] &quot;unavoidable.&quot;                                                                
##  [2060] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2061] &quot;\&quot;Well, then, when will you come back again?\&quot;&quot;                              
##  [2062] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2063] &quot;\&quot;I hope we shall see you at Barton,\&quot; added her ladyship, \&quot;as soon as&quot;     
##  [2064] &quot;you can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party to&quot;           
##  [2065] &quot;Whitwell till you return.\&quot;&quot;                                                 
##  [2066] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2067] &quot;\&quot;You are very obliging.  But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in&quot;     
##  [2068] &quot;my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all.\&quot;&quot;                 
##  [2069] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2070] &quot;\&quot;Oh! he must and shall come back,\&quot; cried Sir John.  \&quot;If he is not here&quot;   
##  [2071] &quot;by the end of the week, I shall go after him.\&quot;&quot;                             
##  [2072] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2073] &quot;\&quot;Ay, so do, Sir John,\&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings, \&quot;and then perhaps you may&quot;    
##  [2074] &quot;find out what his business is.\&quot;&quot;                                            
##  [2075] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2076] &quot;\&quot;I do not want to pry into other men&#39;s concerns.  I suppose it is&quot;          
##  [2077] &quot;something he is ashamed of.\&quot;&quot;                                               
##  [2078] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2079] &quot;Colonel Brandon&#39;s horses were announced.&quot;                                    
##  [2080] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2081] &quot;\&quot;You do not go to town on horseback, do you?\&quot; added Sir John.&quot;             
##  [2082] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2083] &quot;\&quot;No. Only to Honiton.  I shall then go post.\&quot;&quot;                             
##  [2084] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2085] &quot;\&quot;Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey.  But you&quot;      
##  [2086] &quot;had better change your mind.\&quot;&quot;                                              
##  [2087] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2088] &quot;\&quot;I assure you it is not in my power.\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [2089] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2090] &quot;He then took leave of the whole party.&quot;                                      
##  [2091] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2092] &quot;\&quot;Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this&quot;         
##  [2093] &quot;winter, Miss Dashwood?\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [2094] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2095] &quot;\&quot;I am afraid, none at all.\&quot;&quot;                                               
##  [2096] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2097] &quot;\&quot;Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to&quot;      
##  [2098] &quot;do.\&quot;&quot;                                                                       
##  [2099] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2100] &quot;To Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.&quot;                              
##  [2101] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2102] &quot;\&quot;Come Colonel,\&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, \&quot;before you go, do let us know what&quot;  
##  [2103] &quot;you are going about.\&quot;&quot;                                                      
##  [2104] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2105] &quot;He wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the room.&quot;     
##  [2106] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2107] &quot;The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto&quot;               
##  [2108] &quot;restrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again and&quot;      
##  [2109] &quot;again how provoking it was to be so disappointed.&quot;                           
##  [2110] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2111] &quot;\&quot;I can guess what his business is, however,\&quot; said Mrs. Jennings&quot;           
##  [2112] &quot;exultingly.&quot;                                                                 
##  [2113] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2114] &quot;\&quot;Can you, ma&#39;am?\&quot; said almost every body.&quot;                                 
##  [2115] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2116] &quot;\&quot;Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.\&quot;&quot;                              
##  [2117] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2118] &quot;\&quot;And who is Miss Williams?\&quot; asked Marianne.&quot;                               
##  [2119] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2120] &quot;\&quot;What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have&quot;       
##  [2121] &quot;heard of her before.  She is a relation of the Colonel&#39;s, my dear; a&quot;        
##  [2122] &quot;very near relation.  We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the&quot;     
##  [2123] &quot;young ladies.\&quot; Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,&quot;      
##  [2124] &quot;\&quot;She is his natural daughter.\&quot;&quot;                                            
##  [2125] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2126] &quot;\&quot;Indeed!\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [2127] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2128] &quot;\&quot;Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare.  I dare say the Colonel&quot;        
##  [2129] &quot;will leave her all his fortune.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [2130] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2131] &quot;When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regret&quot;       
##  [2132] &quot;on so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as&quot;        
##  [2133] &quot;they were all got together, they must do something by way of being&quot;          
##  [2134] &quot;happy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although&quot;             
##  [2135] &quot;happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a&quot;           
##  [2136] &quot;tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country.  The&quot;              
##  [2137] &quot;carriages were then ordered; Willoughby&#39;s was first, and Marianne never&quot;     
##  [2138] &quot;looked happier than when she got into it.  He drove through the park&quot;        
##  [2139] &quot;very fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of them&quot;        
##  [2140] &quot;was seen till their return, which did not happen till after the return&quot;      
##  [2141] &quot;of all the rest.  They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said&quot;     
##  [2142] &quot;only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the others&quot;     
##  [2143] &quot;went on the downs.&quot;                                                          
##  [2144] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2145] &quot;It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that&quot;        
##  [2146] &quot;every body should be extremely merry all day long.  Some more of the&quot;        
##  [2147] &quot;Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly&quot;     
##  [2148] &quot;twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment.&quot;            
##  [2149] &quot;Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.&quot;       
##  [2150] &quot;Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor&#39;s right hand; and they had not been long&quot;        
##  [2151] &quot;seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said to&quot;             
##  [2152] &quot;Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, \&quot;I have found you out in&quot;      
##  [2153] &quot;spite of all your tricks.  I know where you spent the morning.\&quot;&quot;            
##  [2154] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2155] &quot;Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, \&quot;Where, pray?\&quot;--&quot;             
##  [2156] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2157] &quot;\&quot;Did not you know,\&quot; said Willoughby, \&quot;that we had been out in my&quot;         
##  [2158] &quot;curricle?\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [2159] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2160] &quot;\&quot;Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined&quot;      
##  [2161] &quot;to find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house, Miss&quot;       
##  [2162] &quot;Marianne.  It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you,&quot;      
##  [2163] &quot;I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when&quot;      
##  [2164] &quot;I was there six years ago.\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [2165] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2166] &quot;Marianne turned away in great confusion.  Mrs. Jennings laughed&quot;             
##  [2167] &quot;heartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they&quot;        
##  [2168] &quot;had been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.&quot;                
##  [2169] &quot;Willoughby&#39;s groom; and that she had by that method been informed that&quot;      
##  [2170] &quot;they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in&quot;           
##  [2171] &quot;walking about the garden and going all over the house.&quot;                      
##  [2172] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2173] &quot;Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikely&quot;     
##  [2174] &quot;that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the house&quot;     
##  [2175] &quot;while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest&quot;         
##  [2176] &quot;acquaintance.&quot;                                                               
##  [2177] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2178] &quot;As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it;&quot;      
##  [2179] &quot;and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance&quot;           
##  [2180] &quot;related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angry&quot;      
##  [2181] &quot;with her for doubting it.&quot;                                                   
##  [2182] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2183] &quot;\&quot;Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we&quot;      
##  [2184] &quot;did not see the house?  Is not it what you have often wished to do&quot;          
##  [2185] &quot;yourself?\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [2186] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2187] &quot;\&quot;Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and with&quot;    
##  [2188] &quot;no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.\&quot;&quot;                                   
##  [2189] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2190] &quot;\&quot;Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew&quot;    
##  [2191] &quot;that house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was impossible to&quot;        
##  [2192] &quot;have any other companion.  I never spent a pleasanter morning in my&quot;         
##  [2193] &quot;life.\&quot;&quot;                                                                     
##  [2194] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2195] &quot;\&quot;I am afraid,\&quot; replied Elinor, \&quot;that the pleasantness of an employment&quot;   
##  [2196] &quot;does not always evince its propriety.\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [2197] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2198] &quot;\&quot;On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for if&quot;    
##  [2199] &quot;there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have been&quot;       
##  [2200] &quot;sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting&quot;           
##  [2201] &quot;wrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.\&quot;&quot;           
##  [2202] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2203] &quot;\&quot;But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very&quot;         
##  [2204] &quot;impertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of&quot;        
##  [2205] &quot;your own conduct?\&quot;&quot;                                                         
##  [2206] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2207] &quot;\&quot;If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of&quot;        
##  [2208] &quot;impropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives.&quot;     
##  [2209] &quot;I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation.  I&quot;      
##  [2210] &quot;am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs.&quot;          
##  [2211] &quot;Smith&#39;s grounds, or in seeing her house.  They will one day be Mr.&quot;          
##  [2212] &quot;Willoughby&#39;s, and--\&quot;&quot;                                                       
##  [2213] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2214] &quot;\&quot;If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be&quot;           
##  [2215] &quot;justified in what you have done.\&quot;&quot;                                          
##  [2216] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2217] &quot;She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her;&quot;        
##  [2218] &quot;and after a ten minutes&#39; interval of earnest thought, she came to her&quot;       
##  [2219] &quot;sister again, and said with great good humour, \&quot;Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS&quot;    
##  [2220] &quot;rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted&quot;        
##  [2221] &quot;particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house, I assure&quot;     
##  [2222] &quot;you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice&quot;      
##  [2223] &quot;comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it would&quot;       
##  [2224] &quot;be delightful.  It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.  On&quot;      
##  [2225] &quot;one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a&quot;          
##  [2226] &quot;beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the church&quot;      
##  [2227] &quot;and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so&quot;     
##  [2228] &quot;often admired.  I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be&quot;         
##  [2229] &quot;more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up--a&quot;         
##  [2230] &quot;couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the&quot;         
##  [2231] &quot;pleasantest summer-rooms in England.\&quot;&quot;                                      
##  [2232] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2233] &quot;Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others,&quot;     
##  [2234] &quot;she would have described every room in the house with equal delight.&quot;        
##  [2235] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2236] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2237] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2238] &quot;CHAPTER 14&quot;                                                                  
##  [2239] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2240] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2241] &quot;The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon&#39;s visit at the park, with his&quot;     
##  [2242] &quot;steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the&quot;         
##  [2243] &quot;wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great&quot;              
##  [2244] &quot;wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all&quot;      
##  [2245] &quot;the comings and goings of all their acquaintance.  She wondered, with&quot;       
##  [2246] &quot;little intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there must&quot;     
##  [2247] &quot;be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that could&quot;        
##  [2248] &quot;have befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not escape&quot;     
##  [2249] &quot;them all.&quot;                                                                   
##  [2250] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2251] &quot;\&quot;Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure,\&quot; said she.&quot;      
##  [2252] &quot;\&quot;I could see it in his face.  Poor man!  I am afraid his circumstances&quot;     
##  [2253] &quot;may be bad.  The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two&quot;        
##  [2254] &quot;thousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.  I do&quot;      
##  [2255] &quot;think he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else can&quot;     
##  [2256] &quot;it be?  I wonder whether it is so.  I would give anything to know the&quot;       
##  [2257] &quot;truth of it.  Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare&quot;     
##  [2258] &quot;say it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.  May be&quot;     
##  [2259] &quot;she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I have a&quot;          
##  [2260] &quot;notion she is always rather sickly.  I would lay any wager it is about&quot;      
##  [2261] &quot;Miss Williams.  It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his&quot;     
##  [2262] &quot;circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man, and to be sure must&quot;        
##  [2263] &quot;have cleared the estate by this time.  I wonder what it can be!  May be&quot;     
##  [2264] &quot;his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over.  His setting&quot;     
##  [2265] &quot;off in such a hurry seems very like it.  Well, I wish him out of all&quot;        
##  [2266] &quot;his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain.\&quot;&quot;          
##  [2267] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2268] &quot;So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her opinion varying with every&quot;       
##  [2269] &quot;fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.&quot;           
##  [2270] &quot;Elinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel&quot;         
##  [2271] &quot;Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away,&quot;     
##  [2272] &quot;which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides that the&quot;       
##  [2273] &quot;circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or&quot;       
##  [2274] &quot;variety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It was&quot;       
##  [2275] &quot;engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby on&quot;      
##  [2276] &quot;the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them&quot;      
##  [2277] &quot;all.  As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange&quot;      
##  [2278] &quot;and more incompatible with the disposition of both.  Why they should&quot;        
##  [2279] &quot;not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant&quot;       
##  [2280] &quot;behaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could not&quot;      
##  [2281] &quot;imagine.&quot;                                                                    
##  [2282] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2283] &quot;She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in&quot;         
##  [2284] &quot;their power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reason&quot;     
##  [2285] &quot;to believe him rich.  His estate had been rated by Sir John at about&quot;        
##  [2286] &quot;six or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that&quot;       
##  [2287] &quot;income could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained of&quot;        
##  [2288] &quot;his poverty.  But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them&quot;       
##  [2289] &quot;relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all,&quot;       
##  [2290] &quot;she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to their&quot;          
##  [2291] &quot;general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mind&quot;      
##  [2292] &quot;of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her&quot;     
##  [2293] &quot;making any inquiry of Marianne.&quot;                                             
##  [2294] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2295] &quot;Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than&quot;            
##  [2296] &quot;Willoughby&#39;s behaviour.  To Marianne it had all the distinguishing&quot;          
##  [2297] &quot;tenderness which a lover&#39;s heart could give, and to the rest of the&quot;         
##  [2298] &quot;family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother.  The&quot;       
##  [2299] &quot;cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many more&quot;     
##  [2300] &quot;of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general&quot;           
##  [2301] &quot;engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him&quot;        
##  [2302] &quot;out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest&quot;       
##  [2303] &quot;of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his&quot;         
##  [2304] &quot;favourite pointer at her feet.&quot;                                              
##  [2305] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2306] &quot;One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the&quot;      
##  [2307] &quot;country, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of&quot;        
##  [2308] &quot;attachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s happening&quot;      
##  [2309] &quot;to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmly&quot;     
##  [2310] &quot;opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as&quot;      
##  [2311] &quot;perfect with him.&quot;                                                           
##  [2312] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2313] &quot;\&quot;What!\&quot; he exclaimed--\&quot;Improve this dear cottage!  No. THAT I will&quot;       
##  [2314] &quot;never consent to.  Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch&quot;      
##  [2315] &quot;to its size, if my feelings are regarded.\&quot;&quot;                                 
##  [2316] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2317] &quot;\&quot;Do not be alarmed,\&quot; said Miss Dashwood, \&quot;nothing of the kind will be&quot;    
##  [2318] &quot;done; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it.\&quot;&quot;           
##  [2319] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2320] &quot;\&quot;I am heartily glad of it,\&quot; he cried.  \&quot;May she always be poor, if she&quot;   
##  [2321] &quot;can employ her riches no better.\&quot;&quot;                                          
##  [2322] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2323] &quot;\&quot;Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured that I would not&quot;           
##  [2324] &quot;sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one&quot;         
##  [2325] &quot;whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world.  Depend upon it&quot;        
##  [2326] &quot;that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in&quot;      
##  [2327] &quot;the spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it&quot;      
##  [2328] &quot;in a manner so painful to you.  But are you really so attached to this&quot;      
##  [2329] &quot;place as to see no defect in it?\&quot;&quot;                                          
##  [2330] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2331] &quot;\&quot;I am,\&quot; said he.  \&quot;To me it is faultless.  Nay, more, I consider it as&quot;   
##  [2332] &quot;the only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I&quot;      
##  [2333] &quot;rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again in&quot;     
##  [2334] &quot;the exact plan of this cottage.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [2335] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2336] &quot;\&quot;With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose,\&quot; said&quot;      
##  [2337] &quot;Elinor.&quot;                                                                     
##  [2338] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2339] &quot;\&quot;Yes,\&quot; cried he in the same eager tone, \&quot;with all and every thing&quot;        
##  [2340] &quot;belonging to it;--in no one convenience or INconvenience about it,&quot;          
##  [2341] &quot;should the least variation be perceptible.  Then, and then only, under&quot;      
##  [2342] &quot;such a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at&quot;         
##  [2343] &quot;Barton.\&quot;&quot;                                                                   
##  [2344] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2345] &quot;\&quot;I flatter myself,\&quot; replied Elinor, \&quot;that even under the disadvantage&quot;    
##  [2346] &quot;of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your&quot;       
##  [2347] &quot;own house as faultless as you now do this.\&quot;&quot;                                
##  [2348] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2349] &quot;\&quot;There certainly are circumstances,\&quot; said Willoughby, \&quot;which might&quot;       
##  [2350] &quot;greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of&quot;       
##  [2351] &quot;my affection, which no other can possibly share.\&quot;&quot;                          
##  [2352] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2353] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were&quot;        
##  [2354] &quot;fixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she&quot;        
##  [2355] &quot;understood him.&quot;                                                             
##  [2356] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2357] &quot;\&quot;How often did I wish,\&quot; added he, \&quot;when I was at Allenham this time&quot;      
##  [2358] &quot;twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited!  I never passed within&quot;     
##  [2359] &quot;view of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one&quot;         
##  [2360] &quot;should live in it.  How little did I then think that the very first&quot;         
##  [2361] &quot;news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country,&quot;      
##  [2362] &quot;would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate&quot;             
##  [2363] &quot;satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of&quot;         
##  [2364] &quot;prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account&quot;       
##  [2365] &quot;for.  Must it not have been so, Marianne?\&quot; speaking to her in a lowered&quot;    
##  [2366] &quot;voice.  Then continuing his former tone, he said, \&quot;And yet this house&quot;      
##  [2367] &quot;you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  You would rob it of its simplicity by&quot;      
##  [2368] &quot;imaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance&quot;      
##  [2369] &quot;first began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by&quot;      
##  [2370] &quot;us together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,&quot;       
##  [2371] &quot;and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has&quot;            
##  [2372] &quot;hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort&quot;        
##  [2373] &quot;than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world&quot;          
##  [2374] &quot;could possibly afford.\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [2375] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2376] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should&quot;       
##  [2377] &quot;be attempted.&quot;                                                               
##  [2378] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2379] &quot;\&quot;You are a good woman,\&quot; he warmly replied.  \&quot;Your promise makes me&quot;       
##  [2380] &quot;easy.  Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy.  Tell me&quot;      
##  [2381] &quot;that not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever&quot;        
##  [2382] &quot;find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will&quot;         
##  [2383] &quot;always consider me with the kindness which has made everything&quot;              
##  [2384] &quot;belonging to you so dear to me.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [2385] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2386] &quot;The promise was readily given, and Willoughby&#39;s behaviour during the&quot;        
##  [2387] &quot;whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness.&quot;          
##  [2388] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2389] &quot;\&quot;Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?\&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood, when he was&quot;    
##  [2390] &quot;leaving them.  \&quot;I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we must&quot;       
##  [2391] &quot;walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton.\&quot;&quot;                              
##  [2392] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2393] &quot;He engaged to be with them by four o&#39;clock.&quot;                                 
##  [2394] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2395] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2396] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2397] &quot;CHAPTER 15&quot;                                                                  
##  [2398] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2399] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2400] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and&quot;        
##  [2401] &quot;two of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself from&quot;       
##  [2402] &quot;being of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and her&quot;      
##  [2403] &quot;mother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the&quot;        
##  [2404] &quot;night before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectly&quot;        
##  [2405] &quot;satisfied with her remaining at home.&quot;                                       
##  [2406] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2407] &quot;On their return from the park they found Willoughby&#39;s curricle and&quot;          
##  [2408] &quot;servant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that&quot;     
##  [2409] &quot;her conjecture had been just.  So far it was all as she had foreseen;&quot;       
##  [2410] &quot;but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her&quot;       
##  [2411] &quot;to expect.  They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came&quot;           
##  [2412] &quot;hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with her&quot;       
##  [2413] &quot;handkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.&quot;          
##  [2414] &quot;Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had&quot;         
##  [2415] &quot;just quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning against&quot;     
##  [2416] &quot;the mantel-piece with his back towards them.  He turned round on their&quot;      
##  [2417] &quot;coming in, and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the&quot;       
##  [2418] &quot;emotion which over-powered Marianne.&quot;                                        
##  [2419] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2420] &quot;\&quot;Is anything the matter with her?\&quot; cried Mrs. Dashwood as she&quot;             
##  [2421] &quot;entered--\&quot;is she ill?\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [2422] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2423] &quot;\&quot;I hope not,\&quot; he replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forced&quot;      
##  [2424] &quot;smile presently added, \&quot;It is I who may rather expect to be ill--for I&quot;     
##  [2425] &quot;am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!\&quot;&quot;                       
##  [2426] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2427] &quot;\&quot;Disappointment?\&quot;&quot;                                                         
##  [2428] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2429] &quot;\&quot;Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you.  Mrs. Smith has&quot;      
##  [2430] &quot;this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent&quot;        
##  [2431] &quot;cousin, by sending me on business to London.  I have just received my&quot;       
##  [2432] &quot;dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of&quot;                
##  [2433] &quot;exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.\&quot;&quot;                    
##  [2434] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2435] &quot;\&quot;To London!--and are you going this morning?\&quot;&quot;                             
##  [2436] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2437] &quot;\&quot;Almost this moment.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##  [2438] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2439] &quot;\&quot;This is very unfortunate.  But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and her&quot;       
##  [2440] &quot;business will not detain you from us long I hope.\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [2441] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2442] &quot;He coloured as he replied, \&quot;You are very kind, but I have no idea of&quot;       
##  [2443] &quot;returning into Devonshire immediately.  My visits to Mrs. Smith are&quot;         
##  [2444] &quot;never repeated within the twelvemonth.\&quot;&quot;                                    
##  [2445] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2446] &quot;\&quot;And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?  Is Allenham the only house in the&quot;    
##  [2447] &quot;neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?  For shame, Willoughby, can&quot;     
##  [2448] &quot;you wait for an invitation here?\&quot;&quot;                                          
##  [2449] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2450] &quot;His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only&quot;         
##  [2451] &quot;replied, \&quot;You are too good.\&quot;&quot;                                              
##  [2452] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2453] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.  Elinor felt equal&quot;            
##  [2454] &quot;amazement.  For a few moments every one was silent.  Mrs. Dashwood&quot;          
##  [2455] &quot;first spoke.&quot;                                                                
##  [2456] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2457] &quot;\&quot;I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you&quot;        
##  [2458] &quot;will always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here&quot;             
##  [2459] &quot;immediately, because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing&quot;      
##  [2460] &quot;to Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question&quot;     
##  [2461] &quot;your judgment than to doubt your inclination.\&quot;&quot;                             
##  [2462] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2463] &quot;\&quot;My engagements at present,\&quot; replied Willoughby, confusedly, \&quot;are of&quot;     
##  [2464] &quot;such a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself\&quot;--&quot;                          
##  [2465] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2466] &quot;He stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and another&quot;      
##  [2467] &quot;pause succeeded.  This was broken by Willoughby, who said with a faint&quot;      
##  [2468] &quot;smile, \&quot;It is folly to linger in this manner.  I will not torment&quot;          
##  [2469] &quot;myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is&quot;            
##  [2470] &quot;impossible for me now to enjoy.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [2471] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2472] &quot;He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room.  They saw him&quot;     
##  [2473] &quot;step into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.&quot;                
##  [2474] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2475] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the&quot;           
##  [2476] &quot;parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this&quot;         
##  [2477] &quot;sudden departure occasioned.&quot;                                                
##  [2478] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2479] &quot;Elinor&#39;s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother&#39;s.  She thought of&quot;     
##  [2480] &quot;what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.  Willoughby&#39;s behaviour&quot;     
##  [2481] &quot;in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of&quot;              
##  [2482] &quot;cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother&#39;s&quot;      
##  [2483] &quot;invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself,&quot;            
##  [2484] &quot;greatly disturbed her.  One moment she feared that no serious design&quot;        
##  [2485] &quot;had ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunate&quot;        
##  [2486] &quot;quarrel had taken place between him and her sister;--the distress in&quot;        
##  [2487] &quot;which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could&quot;     
##  [2488] &quot;most reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne&#39;s&quot;     
##  [2489] &quot;love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.&quot;                       
##  [2490] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2491] &quot;But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sister&#39;s&quot;     
##  [2492] &quot;affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the tenderest&quot;              
##  [2493] &quot;compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability&quot;     
##  [2494] &quot;not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a&quot;      
##  [2495] &quot;duty.&quot;                                                                       
##  [2496] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2497] &quot;In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were&quot;         
##  [2498] &quot;red, her countenance was not uncheerful.&quot;                                    
##  [2499] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2500] &quot;\&quot;Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,\&quot; said she,&quot;    
##  [2501] &quot;as she sat down to work, \&quot;and with how heavy a heart does he travel?\&quot;&quot;     
##  [2502] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2503] &quot;\&quot;It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work&quot;    
##  [2504] &quot;of a moment.  And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so&quot;       
##  [2505] &quot;affectionate?  And now, after only ten minutes notice--Gone too without&quot;     
##  [2506] &quot;intending to return!--Something more than what he owned to us must have&quot;     
##  [2507] &quot;happened.  He did not speak, he did not behave like himself.  YOU must&quot;      
##  [2508] &quot;have seen the difference as well as I.  What can it be?  Can they have&quot;      
##  [2509] &quot;quarrelled?  Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept&quot;     
##  [2510] &quot;your invitation here?\&quot;--&quot;                                                   
##  [2511] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2512] &quot;\&quot;It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see&quot;        
##  [2513] &quot;THAT.  He had not the power of accepting it.  I have thought it all&quot;         
##  [2514] &quot;over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at&quot;      
##  [2515] &quot;first seemed strange to me as well as to you.\&quot;&quot;                             
##  [2516] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2517] &quot;\&quot;Can you, indeed!\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##  [2518] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2519] &quot;\&quot;Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--but&quot;     
##  [2520] &quot;you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can--it will not satisfy YOU,&quot;      
##  [2521] &quot;I know; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I am&quot;              
##  [2522] &quot;persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapproves&quot;     
##  [2523] &quot;of it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and on that&quot;           
##  [2524] &quot;account is eager to get him away;--and that the business which she&quot;          
##  [2525] &quot;sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.&quot;          
##  [2526] &quot;This is what I believe to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware that&quot;       
##  [2527] &quot;she DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at present&quot;       
##  [2528] &quot;confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himself&quot;           
##  [2529] &quot;obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, and&quot;        
##  [2530] &quot;absent himself from Devonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,&quot;      
##  [2531] &quot;that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen to no cavil,&quot;      
##  [2532] &quot;unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair&quot;       
##  [2533] &quot;as satisfactory at this.  And now, Elinor, what have you to say?\&quot;&quot;          
##  [2534] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2535] &quot;\&quot;Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.\&quot;&quot;                            
##  [2536] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2537] &quot;\&quot;Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened.&quot;    
##  [2538] &quot;Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings!  You had rather&quot;         
##  [2539] &quot;take evil upon credit than good.  You had rather look out for misery&quot;        
##  [2540] &quot;for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the&quot;        
##  [2541] &quot;latter.  You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leave&quot;     
##  [2542] &quot;of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn.  And is&quot;       
##  [2543] &quot;no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by&quot;       
##  [2544] &quot;recent disappointment?  Are no probabilities to be accepted, merely&quot;         
##  [2545] &quot;because they are not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom we&quot;        
##  [2546] &quot;have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill&quot;       
##  [2547] &quot;of?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though&quot;       
##  [2548] &quot;unavoidably secret for a while?  And, after all, what is it you suspect&quot;     
##  [2549] &quot;him of?\&quot;&quot;                                                                   
##  [2550] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2551] &quot;\&quot;I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of something unpleasant is&quot;       
##  [2552] &quot;the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed&quot;       
##  [2553] &quot;in him.  There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of&quot;       
##  [2554] &quot;the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be&quot;      
##  [2555] &quot;candid in my judgment of every body.  Willoughby may undoubtedly have&quot;       
##  [2556] &quot;very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.&quot;       
##  [2557] &quot;But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at&quot;          
##  [2558] &quot;once.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at&quot;       
##  [2559] &quot;its being practiced by him.\&quot;&quot;                                               
##  [2560] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2561] &quot;\&quot;Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the&quot;    
##  [2562] &quot;deviation is necessary.  But you really do admit the justice of what I&quot;      
##  [2563] &quot;have said in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.\&quot;&quot;               
##  [2564] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2565] &quot;\&quot;Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if they&quot;      
##  [2566] &quot;ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--and if that is the case, it must be&quot;           
##  [2567] &quot;highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at&quot;           
##  [2568] &quot;present.  But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.\&quot;&quot;          
##  [2569] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2570] &quot;\&quot;Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and&quot;        
##  [2571] &quot;Marianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have&quot;        
##  [2572] &quot;been reproaching them every day for incautiousness.\&quot;&quot;                       
##  [2573] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2574] &quot;\&quot;I want no proof of their affection,\&quot; said Elinor; \&quot;but of their&quot;         
##  [2575] &quot;engagement I do.\&quot;&quot;                                                          
##  [2576] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2577] &quot;\&quot;I am perfectly satisfied of both.\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [2578] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2579] &quot;\&quot;Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of&quot;      
##  [2580] &quot;them.\&quot;&quot;                                                                     
##  [2581] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2582] &quot;\&quot;I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly.  Has&quot;    
##  [2583] &quot;not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last&quot;       
##  [2584] &quot;fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future&quot;          
##  [2585] &quot;wife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?&quot;       
##  [2586] &quot;Have we not perfectly understood each other?  Has not my consent been&quot;       
##  [2587] &quot;daily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate&quot;        
##  [2588] &quot;respect?  My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement?  How&quot;         
##  [2589] &quot;could such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed that&quot;           
##  [2590] &quot;Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister&#39;s love, should leave&quot;     
##  [2591] &quot;her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of his&quot;           
##  [2592] &quot;affection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange of&quot;              
##  [2593] &quot;confidence?\&quot;&quot;                                                               
##  [2594] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2595] &quot;\&quot;I confess,\&quot; replied Elinor, \&quot;that every circumstance except ONE is in&quot;   
##  [2596] &quot;favour of their engagement; but that ONE is the total silence of both&quot;       
##  [2597] &quot;on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.\&quot;&quot;              
##  [2598] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2599] &quot;\&quot;How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby,&quot;     
##  [2600] &quot;if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the&quot;        
##  [2601] &quot;nature of the terms on which they are together.  Has he been acting a&quot;       
##  [2602] &quot;part in his behaviour to your sister all this time?  Do you suppose him&quot;     
##  [2603] &quot;really indifferent to her?\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [2604] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2605] &quot;\&quot;No, I cannot think that.  He must and does love her I am sure.\&quot;&quot;          
##  [2606] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2607] &quot;\&quot;But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such&quot;      
##  [2608] &quot;indifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him.\&quot;&quot;   
##  [2609] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2610] &quot;\&quot;You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this&quot;      
##  [2611] &quot;matter as certain.  I have had my doubts, I confess; but they are&quot;           
##  [2612] &quot;fainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away.  If we&quot;     
##  [2613] &quot;find they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed.\&quot;&quot;                 
##  [2614] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2615] &quot;\&quot;A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see them at the altar, you&quot;    
##  [2616] &quot;would suppose they were going to be married.  Ungracious girl!  But I&quot;       
##  [2617] &quot;require no such proof.  Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to&quot;            
##  [2618] &quot;justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly&quot;        
##  [2619] &quot;open and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister&#39;s wishes.  It must&quot;       
##  [2620] &quot;be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?  Is he not a man of&quot;     
##  [2621] &quot;honour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to&quot;         
##  [2622] &quot;create alarm? can he be deceitful?\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [2623] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2624] &quot;\&quot;I hope not, I believe not,\&quot; cried Elinor.  \&quot;I love Willoughby,&quot;          
##  [2625] &quot;sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more&quot;           
##  [2626] &quot;painful to yourself than to me.  It has been involuntary, and I will&quot;        
##  [2627] &quot;not encourage it.  I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his&quot;      
##  [2628] &quot;manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself, and did not&quot;           
##  [2629] &quot;return your kindness with any cordiality.  But all this may be&quot;              
##  [2630] &quot;explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed.  He&quot;      
##  [2631] &quot;had just parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest&quot;      
##  [2632] &quot;affliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs.&quot;           
##  [2633] &quot;Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware&quot;       
##  [2634] &quot;that by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away for&quot;     
##  [2635] &quot;some time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by&quot;        
##  [2636] &quot;our family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  In such a&quot;          
##  [2637] &quot;case, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more&quot;      
##  [2638] &quot;to his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general&quot;          
##  [2639] &quot;character;--but I will not raise objections against any one&#39;s conduct&quot;       
##  [2640] &quot;on so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself,&quot;      
##  [2641] &quot;or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent.\&quot;&quot;                
##  [2642] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2643] &quot;\&quot;You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be&quot;     
##  [2644] &quot;suspected.  Though WE have not known him long, he is no stranger in&quot;         
##  [2645] &quot;this part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?&quot;        
##  [2646] &quot;Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,&quot;      
##  [2647] &quot;it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging&quot;        
##  [2648] &quot;everything to me at once: but this is not the case.  It is an&quot;               
##  [2649] &quot;engagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage&quot;      
##  [2650] &quot;must be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it&quot;        
##  [2651] &quot;can be observed, may now be very advisable.\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [2652] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2653] &quot;They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was then&quot;      
##  [2654] &quot;at liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to&quot;              
##  [2655] &quot;acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.&quot;       
##  [2656] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2657] &quot;They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered the&quot;         
##  [2658] &quot;room and took her place at the table without saying a word.  Her eyes&quot;       
##  [2659] &quot;were red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even then&quot;          
##  [2660] &quot;restrained with difficulty.  She avoided the looks of them all, could&quot;       
##  [2661] &quot;neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother&#39;s silently&quot;        
##  [2662] &quot;pressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of fortitude&quot;     
##  [2663] &quot;was quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room.&quot;                 
##  [2664] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2665] &quot;This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening.  She&quot;        
##  [2666] &quot;was without any power, because she was without any desire of command&quot;        
##  [2667] &quot;over herself.  The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby&quot;     
##  [2668] &quot;overpowered her in an instant; and though her family were most&quot;              
##  [2669] &quot;anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if they&quot;     
##  [2670] &quot;spoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelings&quot;             
##  [2671] &quot;connected with him.&quot;                                                         
##  [2672] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2673] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2674] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2675] &quot;CHAPTER 16&quot;                                                                  
##  [2676] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2677] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2678] &quot;Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able&quot;      
##  [2679] &quot;to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby.  She&quot;         
##  [2680] &quot;would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next&quot;             
##  [2681] &quot;morning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than&quot;         
##  [2682] &quot;when she lay down in it.  But the feelings which made such composure a&quot;      
##  [2683] &quot;disgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it.  She was awake the&quot;         
##  [2684] &quot;whole night, and she wept the greatest part of it.  She got up with a&quot;       
##  [2685] &quot;headache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;&quot;        
##  [2686] &quot;giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding all&quot;      
##  [2687] &quot;attempt at consolation from either.  Her sensibility was potent enough!&quot;     
##  [2688] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2689] &quot;When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about&quot;       
##  [2690] &quot;the village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoyment&quot;       
##  [2691] &quot;and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning.&quot;           
##  [2692] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2693] &quot;The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling.  She played&quot;      
##  [2694] &quot;over every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby,&quot;     
##  [2695] &quot;every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat at&quot;        
##  [2696] &quot;the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out&quot;        
##  [2697] &quot;for her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be&quot;       
##  [2698] &quot;gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied.  She spent&quot;     
##  [2699] &quot;whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying; her voice&quot;     
##  [2700] &quot;often totally suspended by her tears.  In books too, as well as in&quot;          
##  [2701] &quot;music, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and&quot;         
##  [2702] &quot;present was certain of giving.  She read nothing but what they had been&quot;     
##  [2703] &quot;used to read together.&quot;                                                      
##  [2704] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2705] &quot;Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; it&quot;      
##  [2706] &quot;sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these employments,&quot;     
##  [2707] &quot;to which she daily recurred, her solitary walks and silent meditations,&quot;     
##  [2708] &quot;still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.&quot;            
##  [2709] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2710] &quot;No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne.&quot;       
##  [2711] &quot;Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy.  But Mrs.&quot;         
##  [2712] &quot;Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them, which at&quot;         
##  [2713] &quot;least satisfied herself.&quot;                                                    
##  [2714] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2715] &quot;\&quot;Remember, Elinor,\&quot; said she, \&quot;how very often Sir John fetches our&quot;       
##  [2716] &quot;letters himself from the post, and carries them to it.  We have already&quot;     
##  [2717] &quot;agreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it&quot;       
##  [2718] &quot;could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through&quot;        
##  [2719] &quot;Sir John&#39;s hands.\&quot;&quot;                                                         
##  [2720] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2721] &quot;Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried to find in it a&quot;      
##  [2722] &quot;motive sufficient for their silence.  But there was one method so&quot;           
##  [2723] &quot;direct, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real&quot;       
##  [2724] &quot;state of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that she&quot;        
##  [2725] &quot;could not help suggesting it to her mother.&quot;                                 
##  [2726] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2727] &quot;\&quot;Why do you not ask Marianne at once,\&quot; said she, \&quot;whether she is or she&quot;  
##  [2728] &quot;is not engaged to Willoughby?  From you, her mother, and so kind, so&quot;        
##  [2729] &quot;indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence.  It would be&quot;       
##  [2730] &quot;the natural result of your affection for her.  She used to be all&quot;           
##  [2731] &quot;unreserve, and to you more especially.\&quot;&quot;                                    
##  [2732] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2733] &quot;\&quot;I would not ask such a question for the world.  Supposing it possible&quot;     
##  [2734] &quot;that they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiry&quot;          
##  [2735] &quot;inflict!  At any rate it would be most ungenerous.  I should never&quot;          
##  [2736] &quot;deserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession of&quot;        
##  [2737] &quot;what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.  I know&quot;           
##  [2738] &quot;Marianne&#39;s heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall not&quot;     
##  [2739] &quot;be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances make&quot;       
##  [2740] &quot;the revealment of it eligible.  I would not attempt to force the&quot;            
##  [2741] &quot;confidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty&quot;        
##  [2742] &quot;would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct.\&quot;&quot;                   
##  [2743] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2744] &quot;Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister&#39;s&quot;       
##  [2745] &quot;youth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, common&quot;      
##  [2746] &quot;care, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s romantic&quot;            
##  [2747] &quot;delicacy.&quot;                                                                   
##  [2748] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2749] &quot;It was several days before Willoughby&#39;s name was mentioned before&quot;           
##  [2750] &quot;Marianne by any of her family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were&quot;     
##  [2751] &quot;not so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--but&quot;       
##  [2752] &quot;one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of&quot;              
##  [2753] &quot;Shakespeare, exclaimed,&quot;                                                     
##  [2754] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2755] &quot;\&quot;We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went away&quot;    
##  [2756] &quot;before we could get through it.  We will put it by, that when he comes&quot;      
##  [2757] &quot;again...But it may be months, perhaps, before THAT happens.\&quot;&quot;               
##  [2758] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2759] &quot;\&quot;Months!\&quot; cried Marianne, with strong surprise.  \&quot;No--nor many weeks.\&quot;&quot;  
##  [2760] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2761] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said; but it gave Elinor&quot;           
##  [2762] &quot;pleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of&quot;             
##  [2763] &quot;confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions.&quot;                   
##  [2764] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2765] &quot;One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne was&quot;       
##  [2766] &quot;prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of&quot;            
##  [2767] &quot;wandering away by herself.  Hitherto she had carefully avoided every&quot;        
##  [2768] &quot;companion in her rambles.  If her sisters intended to walk on the&quot;           
##  [2769] &quot;downs, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of the&quot;     
##  [2770] &quot;valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be&quot;         
##  [2771] &quot;found when the others set off.  But at length she was secured by the&quot;        
##  [2772] &quot;exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.&quot;      
##  [2773] &quot;They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,&quot;      
##  [2774] &quot;for Marianne&#39;s MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied with&quot;     
##  [2775] &quot;gaining one point, would not then attempt more.  Beyond the entrance of&quot;     
##  [2776] &quot;the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less wild and&quot;         
##  [2777] &quot;more open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first&quot;     
##  [2778] &quot;coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point, they&quot;         
##  [2779] &quot;stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed the&quot;        
##  [2780] &quot;distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they had&quot;         
##  [2781] &quot;never happened to reach in any of their walks before.&quot;                       
##  [2782] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2783] &quot;Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated one;&quot;     
##  [2784] &quot;it was a man on horseback riding towards them.  In a few minutes they&quot;       
##  [2785] &quot;could distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment afterwards&quot;         
##  [2786] &quot;Marianne rapturously exclaimed,&quot;                                             
##  [2787] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2788] &quot;\&quot;It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!\&quot;--and was hastening to meet&quot;       
##  [2789] &quot;him, when Elinor cried out,&quot;                                                 
##  [2790] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2791] &quot;\&quot;Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is not Willoughby.&quot;        
##  [2792] &quot;The person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air.\&quot;&quot;               
##  [2793] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2794] &quot;\&quot;He has, he has,\&quot; cried Marianne, \&quot;I am sure he has.  His air, his&quot;       
##  [2795] &quot;coat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would come.\&quot;&quot;                          
##  [2796] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2797] &quot;She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne from&quot;     
##  [2798] &quot;particularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby,&quot;      
##  [2799] &quot;quickened her pace and kept up with her.  They were soon within thirty&quot;      
##  [2800] &quot;yards of the gentleman.  Marianne looked again; her heart sunk within&quot;       
##  [2801] &quot;her; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voices&quot;     
##  [2802] &quot;of both her sisters were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well&quot;      
##  [2803] &quot;known as Willoughby&#39;s, joined them in begging her to stop, and she&quot;          
##  [2804] &quot;turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.&quot;               
##  [2805] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2806] &quot;He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be&quot;             
##  [2807] &quot;forgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained a&quot;     
##  [2808] &quot;smile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her&quot;     
##  [2809] &quot;sister&#39;s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.&quot;                
##  [2810] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2811] &quot;He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back with&quot;        
##  [2812] &quot;them to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them.&quot;              
##  [2813] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2814] &quot;He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by&quot;        
##  [2815] &quot;Marianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than&quot;     
##  [2816] &quot;even Elinor herself.  To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward&quot;       
##  [2817] &quot;and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness&quot;        
##  [2818] &quot;which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.  On&quot;      
##  [2819] &quot;Edward&#39;s side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that a&quot;      
##  [2820] &quot;lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.  He was confused,&quot;          
##  [2821] &quot;seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neither&quot;         
##  [2822] &quot;rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by&quot;              
##  [2823] &quot;questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.  Marianne&quot;      
##  [2824] &quot;saw and listened with increasing surprise.  She began almost to feel a&quot;      
##  [2825] &quot;dislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, by&quot;     
##  [2826] &quot;carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a&quot;            
##  [2827] &quot;contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.&quot;               
##  [2828] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2829] &quot;After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries&quot;      
##  [2830] &quot;of meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London.  No,&quot;     
##  [2831] &quot;he had been in Devonshire a fortnight.&quot;                                      
##  [2832] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2833] &quot;\&quot;A fortnight!\&quot; she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the same&quot;   
##  [2834] &quot;county with Elinor without seeing her before.&quot;                               
##  [2835] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2836] &quot;He looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying with&quot;      
##  [2837] &quot;some friends near Plymouth.&quot;                                                 
##  [2838] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2839] &quot;\&quot;Have you been lately in Sussex?\&quot; said Elinor.&quot;                            
##  [2840] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2841] &quot;\&quot;I was at Norland about a month ago.\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [2842] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2843] &quot;\&quot;And how does dear, dear Norland look?\&quot; cried Marianne.&quot;                   
##  [2844] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2845] &quot;\&quot;Dear, dear Norland,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;probably looks much as it always&quot;     
##  [2846] &quot;does at this time of the year.  The woods and walks thickly covered&quot;         
##  [2847] &quot;with dead leaves.\&quot;&quot;                                                         
##  [2848] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2849] &quot;\&quot;Oh,\&quot; cried Marianne, \&quot;with what transporting sensation have I formerly&quot;  
##  [2850] &quot;seen them fall!  How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven&quot;      
##  [2851] &quot;in showers about me by the wind!  What feelings have they, the season,&quot;      
##  [2852] &quot;the air altogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.  They&quot;     
##  [2853] &quot;are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much as&quot;       
##  [2854] &quot;possible from the sight.\&quot;&quot;                                                  
##  [2855] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2856] &quot;\&quot;It is not every one,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;who has your passion for dead&quot;       
##  [2857] &quot;leaves.\&quot;&quot;                                                                   
##  [2858] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2859] &quot;\&quot;No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood.  But&quot;          
##  [2860] &quot;SOMETIMES they are.\&quot;--As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for a&quot;      
##  [2861] &quot;few moments;--but rousing herself again, \&quot;Now, Edward,\&quot; said she,&quot;         
##  [2862] &quot;calling his attention to the prospect, \&quot;here is Barton valley.  Look up&quot;    
##  [2863] &quot;to it, and be tranquil if you can.  Look at those hills!  Did you ever&quot;      
##  [2864] &quot;see their equals?  To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and&quot;      
##  [2865] &quot;plantations.  You may see the end of the house.  And there, beneath&quot;         
##  [2866] &quot;that farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.\&quot;&quot;       
##  [2867] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2868] &quot;\&quot;It is a beautiful country,\&quot; he replied; \&quot;but these bottoms must be&quot;      
##  [2869] &quot;dirty in winter.\&quot;&quot;                                                          
##  [2870] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2871] &quot;\&quot;How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?\&quot;&quot;                
##  [2872] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2873] &quot;\&quot;Because,\&quot; replied he, smiling, \&quot;among the rest of the objects before&quot;    
##  [2874] &quot;me, I see a very dirty lane.\&quot;&quot;                                              
##  [2875] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2876] &quot;\&quot;How strange!\&quot; said Marianne to herself as she walked on.&quot;                 
##  [2877] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2878] &quot;\&quot;Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  Are the Middletons pleasant&quot;    
##  [2879] &quot;people?\&quot;&quot;                                                                   
##  [2880] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2881] &quot;\&quot;No, not all,\&quot; answered Marianne; \&quot;we could not be more unfortunately&quot;    
##  [2882] &quot;situated.\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [2883] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2884] &quot;\&quot;Marianne,\&quot; cried her sister, \&quot;how can you say so? How can you be so&quot;     
##  [2885] &quot;unjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards&quot;       
##  [2886] &quot;us have behaved in the friendliest manner.  Have you forgot, Marianne,&quot;      
##  [2887] &quot;how many pleasant days we have owed to them?\&quot;&quot;                              
##  [2888] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2889] &quot;\&quot;No,\&quot; said Marianne, in a low voice, \&quot;nor how many painful moments.\&quot;&quot;    
##  [2890] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2891] &quot;Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to their&quot;         
##  [2892] &quot;visitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, by&quot;       
##  [2893] &quot;talking of their present residence, its conveniences, &amp;c. extorting&quot;         
##  [2894] &quot;from him occasional questions and remarks.  His coldness and reserve&quot;        
##  [2895] &quot;mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving to&quot;      
##  [2896] &quot;regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present, she&quot;      
##  [2897] &quot;avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated him&quot;      
##  [2898] &quot;as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.&quot;           
##  [2899] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2900] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2901] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2902] &quot;CHAPTER 17&quot;                                                                  
##  [2903] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2904] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2905] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him; for his&quot;        
##  [2906] &quot;coming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural.&quot;       
##  [2907] &quot;Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder.  He received&quot;     
##  [2908] &quot;the kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not&quot;      
##  [2909] &quot;stand against such a reception.  They had begun to fail him before he&quot;       
##  [2910] &quot;entered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating&quot;          
##  [2911] &quot;manners of Mrs. Dashwood.  Indeed a man could not very well be in love&quot;      
##  [2912] &quot;with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; and&quot;     
##  [2913] &quot;Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like&quot;             
##  [2914] &quot;himself.  His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his&quot;      
##  [2915] &quot;interest in their welfare again became perceptible.  He was not in&quot;          
##  [2916] &quot;spirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, was&quot;         
##  [2917] &quot;attentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits.  The whole family&quot;     
##  [2918] &quot;perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of&quot;             
##  [2919] &quot;liberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all&quot;           
##  [2920] &quot;selfish parents.&quot;                                                            
##  [2921] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2922] &quot;\&quot;What are Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s views for you at present, Edward?\&quot; said she,&quot;     
##  [2923] &quot;when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; \&quot;are you still&quot;     
##  [2924] &quot;to be a great orator in spite of yourself?\&quot;&quot;                                
##  [2925] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2926] &quot;\&quot;No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than&quot;    
##  [2927] &quot;inclination for a public life!\&quot;&quot;                                            
##  [2928] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2929] &quot;\&quot;But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to&quot;         
##  [2930] &quot;satisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no&quot;            
##  [2931] &quot;affection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find&quot;      
##  [2932] &quot;it a difficult matter.\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [2933] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2934] &quot;\&quot;I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be distinguished; and have&quot;     
##  [2935] &quot;every reason to hope I never shall.  Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced&quot;       
##  [2936] &quot;into genius and eloquence.\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [2937] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2938] &quot;\&quot;You have no ambition, I well know.  Your wishes are all moderate.\&quot;&quot;       
##  [2939] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2940] &quot;\&quot;As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe.  I wish as&quot;      
##  [2941] &quot;well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body&quot;         
##  [2942] &quot;else it must be in my own way.  Greatness will not make me so.\&quot;&quot;            
##  [2943] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2944] &quot;\&quot;Strange that it would!\&quot; cried Marianne.  \&quot;What have wealth or grandeur&quot;  
##  [2945] &quot;to do with happiness?\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##  [2946] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2947] &quot;\&quot;Grandeur has but little,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;but wealth has much to do with&quot;  
##  [2948] &quot;it.\&quot;&quot;                                                                       
##  [2949] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2950] &quot;\&quot;Elinor, for shame!\&quot; said Marianne, \&quot;money can only give happiness&quot;       
##  [2951] &quot;where there is nothing else to give it.  Beyond a competence, it can&quot;        
##  [2952] &quot;afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.\&quot;&quot;            
##  [2953] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2954] &quot;\&quot;Perhaps,\&quot; said Elinor, smiling, \&quot;we may come to the same point.  YOUR&quot;   
##  [2955] &quot;competence and MY wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and without&quot;       
##  [2956] &quot;them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of&quot;         
##  [2957] &quot;external comfort must be wanting.  Your ideas are only more noble than&quot;      
##  [2958] &quot;mine.  Come, what is your competence?\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [2959] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2960] &quot;\&quot;About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than THAT.\&quot;&quot;      
##  [2961] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2962] &quot;Elinor laughed.  \&quot;TWO thousand a year! ONE is my wealth! I guessed how&quot;     
##  [2963] &quot;it would end.\&quot;&quot;                                                             
##  [2964] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2965] &quot;\&quot;And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,\&quot; said Marianne.&quot;   
##  [2966] &quot;\&quot;A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller.  I am sure I am not&quot;      
##  [2967] &quot;extravagant in my demands.  A proper establishment of servants, a&quot;           
##  [2968] &quot;carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less.\&quot;&quot;          
##  [2969] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2970] &quot;Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately their&quot;      
##  [2971] &quot;future expenses at Combe Magna.&quot;                                             
##  [2972] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2973] &quot;\&quot;Hunters!\&quot; repeated Edward--\&quot;but why must you have hunters?  Every body&quot;  
##  [2974] &quot;does not hunt.\&quot;&quot;                                                            
##  [2975] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2976] &quot;Marianne coloured as she replied, \&quot;But most people do.\&quot;&quot;                   
##  [2977] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2978] &quot;\&quot;I wish,\&quot; said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, \&quot;that somebody&quot;    
##  [2979] &quot;would give us all a large fortune apiece!\&quot;&quot;                                 
##  [2980] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2981] &quot;\&quot;Oh that they would!\&quot; cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling with&quot;             
##  [2982] &quot;animation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary&quot;        
##  [2983] &quot;happiness.&quot;                                                                  
##  [2984] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2985] &quot;\&quot;We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;in spite&quot;   
##  [2986] &quot;of the insufficiency of wealth.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [2987] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2988] &quot;\&quot;Oh dear!\&quot; cried Margaret, \&quot;how happy I should be!  I wonder what I&quot;      
##  [2989] &quot;should do with it!\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##  [2990] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2991] &quot;Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.&quot;                       
##  [2992] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2993] &quot;\&quot;I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,\&quot; said Mrs.&quot;       
##  [2994] &quot;Dashwood, \&quot;if my children were all to be rich without my help.\&quot;&quot;           
##  [2995] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2996] &quot;\&quot;You must begin your improvements on this house,\&quot; observed Elinor, \&quot;and&quot;  
##  [2997] &quot;your difficulties will soon vanish.\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [2998] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [2999] &quot;\&quot;What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London,\&quot; said&quot;   
##  [3000] &quot;Edward, \&quot;in such an event!  What a happy day for booksellers,&quot;              
##  [3001] &quot;music-sellers, and print-shops!  You, Miss Dashwood, would give a&quot;           
##  [3002] &quot;general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you--and as&quot;      
##  [3003] &quot;for Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music&quot;        
##  [3004] &quot;enough in London to content her.  And books!--Thomson, Cowper,&quot;              
##  [3005] &quot;Scott--she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up&quot;         
##  [3006] &quot;every copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands;&quot;        
##  [3007] &quot;and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old&quot;           
##  [3008] &quot;twisted tree.  Should not you, Marianne?  Forgive me, if I am very&quot;          
##  [3009] &quot;saucy.  But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old&quot;         
##  [3010] &quot;disputes.\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [3011] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3012] &quot;\&quot;I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it be melancholy or&quot;    
##  [3013] &quot;gay, I love to recall it--and you will never offend me by talking of&quot;        
##  [3014] &quot;former times.  You are very right in supposing how my money would be&quot;        
##  [3015] &quot;spent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly be employed&quot;      
##  [3016] &quot;in improving my collection of music and books.\&quot;&quot;                            
##  [3017] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3018] &quot;\&quot;And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the&quot;        
##  [3019] &quot;authors or their heirs.\&quot;&quot;                                                   
##  [3020] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3021] &quot;\&quot;No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.\&quot;&quot;                 
##  [3022] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3023] &quot;\&quot;Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who&quot;         
##  [3024] &quot;wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever&quot;      
##  [3025] &quot;be in love more than once in their life--your opinion on that point is&quot;      
##  [3026] &quot;unchanged, I presume?\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##  [3027] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3028] &quot;\&quot;Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.  It is&quot;      
##  [3029] &quot;not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them.\&quot;&quot;        
##  [3030] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3031] &quot;\&quot;Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;she is not&quot;    
##  [3032] &quot;at all altered.\&quot;&quot;                                                           
##  [3033] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3034] &quot;\&quot;She is only grown a little more grave than she was.\&quot;&quot;                     
##  [3035] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3036] &quot;\&quot;Nay, Edward,\&quot; said Marianne, \&quot;you need not reproach me.  You are not&quot;    
##  [3037] &quot;very gay yourself.\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##  [3038] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3039] &quot;\&quot;Why should you think so!\&quot; replied he, with a sigh.  \&quot;But gaiety never&quot;   
##  [3040] &quot;was a part of MY character.\&quot;&quot;                                               
##  [3041] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3042] &quot;\&quot;Nor do I think it a part of Marianne&#39;s,\&quot; said Elinor; \&quot;I should hardly&quot;  
##  [3043] &quot;call her a lively girl--she is very earnest, very eager in all she&quot;          
##  [3044] &quot;does--sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation--but she&quot;       
##  [3045] &quot;is not often really merry.\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [3046] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3047] &quot;\&quot;I believe you are right,\&quot; he replied, \&quot;and yet I have always set her&quot;    
##  [3048] &quot;down as a lively girl.\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [3049] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3050] &quot;\&quot;I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,\&quot; said&quot;        
##  [3051] &quot;Elinor, \&quot;in a total misapprehension of character in some point or&quot;          
##  [3052] &quot;other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or&quot;           
##  [3053] &quot;stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the&quot;       
##  [3054] &quot;deception originated.  Sometimes one is guided by what they say of&quot;          
##  [3055] &quot;themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,&quot;           
##  [3056] &quot;without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.\&quot;&quot;                      
##  [3057] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3058] &quot;\&quot;But I thought it was right, Elinor,\&quot; said Marianne, \&quot;to be guided&quot;       
##  [3059] &quot;wholly by the opinion of other people.  I thought our judgments were&quot;        
##  [3060] &quot;given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours.  This has&quot;         
##  [3061] &quot;always been your doctrine, I am sure.\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [3062] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3063] &quot;\&quot;No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of&quot;    
##  [3064] &quot;the understanding.  All I have ever attempted to influence has been the&quot;     
##  [3065] &quot;behaviour.  You must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty, I confess,&quot;      
##  [3066] &quot;of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with&quot;        
##  [3067] &quot;greater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their&quot;               
##  [3068] &quot;sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?\&quot;&quot;            
##  [3069] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3070] &quot;\&quot;You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of&quot;          
##  [3071] &quot;general civility,\&quot; said Edward to Elinor.  \&quot;Do you gain no ground?\&quot;&quot;      
##  [3072] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3073] &quot;\&quot;Quite the contrary,\&quot; replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne.&quot;   
##  [3074] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3075] &quot;\&quot;My judgment,\&quot; he returned, \&quot;is all on your side of the question; but I&quot;  
##  [3076] &quot;am afraid my practice is much more on your sister&#39;s.  I never wish to&quot;       
##  [3077] &quot;offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I&quot;      
##  [3078] &quot;am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.  I have frequently thought&quot;     
##  [3079] &quot;that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I&quot;       
##  [3080] &quot;am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!\&quot;&quot;                     
##  [3081] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3082] &quot;\&quot;Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers,\&quot; said&quot;        
##  [3083] &quot;Elinor.&quot;                                                                     
##  [3084] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3085] &quot;\&quot;She knows her own worth too well for false shame,\&quot; replied Edward.&quot;       
##  [3086] &quot;\&quot;Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or&quot;       
##  [3087] &quot;other.  If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy&quot;      
##  [3088] &quot;and graceful, I should not be shy.\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [3089] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3090] &quot;\&quot;But you would still be reserved,\&quot; said Marianne, \&quot;and that is worse.\&quot;&quot;  
##  [3091] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3092] &quot;Edward started--\&quot;Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?\&quot;&quot;                      
##  [3093] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3094] &quot;\&quot;Yes, very.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [3095] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3096] &quot;\&quot;I do not understand you,\&quot; replied he, colouring.  \&quot;Reserved!--how, in&quot;   
##  [3097] &quot;what manner?  What am I to tell you?  What can you suppose?\&quot;&quot;               
##  [3098] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3099] &quot;Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to laugh off the&quot;         
##  [3100] &quot;subject, she said to him, \&quot;Do not you know my sister well enough to&quot;        
##  [3101] &quot;understand what she means?  Do not you know she calls every one&quot;             
##  [3102] &quot;reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as&quot;          
##  [3103] &quot;rapturously as herself?\&quot;&quot;                                                   
##  [3104] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3105] &quot;Edward made no answer.  His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him&quot;      
##  [3106] &quot;in their fullest extent--and he sat for some time silent and dull.&quot;          
##  [3107] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3108] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3109] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3110] &quot;CHAPTER 18&quot;                                                                  
##  [3111] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3112] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3113] &quot;Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend.  His&quot;       
##  [3114] &quot;visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his own&quot;           
##  [3115] &quot;enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect.  It was evident that he was&quot;          
##  [3116] &quot;unhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished&quot;     
##  [3117] &quot;her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of&quot;               
##  [3118] &quot;inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very&quot;       
##  [3119] &quot;uncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted&quot;      
##  [3120] &quot;one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.&quot;       
##  [3121] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3122] &quot;He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning&quot;           
##  [3123] &quot;before the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager to&quot;          
##  [3124] &quot;promote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them to&quot;              
##  [3125] &quot;themselves.  But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour&quot;     
##  [3126] &quot;door open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself&quot;         
##  [3127] &quot;come out.&quot;                                                                   
##  [3128] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3129] &quot;\&quot;I am going into the village to see my horses,\&quot; said he, \&quot;as you are&quot;     
##  [3130] &quot;not yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently.\&quot;&quot;             
##  [3131] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3132] &quot;                    ***&quot;                                                     
##  [3133] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3134] &quot;Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding&quot;            
##  [3135] &quot;country; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the&quot;          
##  [3136] &quot;valley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher situation&quot;     
##  [3137] &quot;than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had&quot;           
##  [3138] &quot;exceedingly pleased him.  This was a subject which ensured Marianne&#39;s&quot;       
##  [3139] &quot;attention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of&quot;          
##  [3140] &quot;these scenes, and to question him more minutely on the objects that had&quot;     
##  [3141] &quot;particularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her by saying, \&quot;You&quot;       
##  [3142] &quot;must not enquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge in the&quot;     
##  [3143] &quot;picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste&quot;       
##  [3144] &quot;if we come to particulars.  I shall call hills steep, which ought to be&quot;     
##  [3145] &quot;bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and&quot;         
##  [3146] &quot;rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be&quot;            
##  [3147] &quot;indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.  You must be&quot;       
##  [3148] &quot;satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give.  I call it a&quot;         
##  [3149] &quot;very fine country--the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine&quot;         
##  [3150] &quot;timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich meadows&quot;        
##  [3151] &quot;and several neat farm houses scattered here and there.  It exactly&quot;          
##  [3152] &quot;answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty with&quot;            
##  [3153] &quot;utility--and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you admire&quot;     
##  [3154] &quot;it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey&quot;      
##  [3155] &quot;moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.  I know nothing of&quot;       
##  [3156] &quot;the picturesque.\&quot;&quot;                                                          
##  [3157] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3158] &quot;\&quot;I am afraid it is but too true,\&quot; said Marianne; \&quot;but why should you&quot;     
##  [3159] &quot;boast of it?\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [3160] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3161] &quot;\&quot;I suspect,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;that to avoid one kind of affectation,&quot;        
##  [3162] &quot;Edward here falls into another.  Because he believes many people&quot;            
##  [3163] &quot;pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really&quot;       
##  [3164] &quot;feel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater&quot;            
##  [3165] &quot;indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he&quot;        
##  [3166] &quot;possesses.  He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.\&quot;&quot;     
##  [3167] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3168] &quot;\&quot;It is very true,\&quot; said Marianne, \&quot;that admiration of landscape scenery&quot;  
##  [3169] &quot;is become a mere jargon.  Every body pretends to feel and tries to&quot;          
##  [3170] &quot;describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what&quot;          
##  [3171] &quot;picturesque beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I&quot;     
##  [3172] &quot;have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to&quot;        
##  [3173] &quot;describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and&quot;       
##  [3174] &quot;meaning.\&quot;&quot;                                                                  
##  [3175] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3176] &quot;\&quot;I am convinced,\&quot; said Edward, \&quot;that you really feel all the delight in&quot;  
##  [3177] &quot;a fine prospect which you profess to feel.  But, in return, your sister&quot;     
##  [3178] &quot;must allow me to feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect,&quot;      
##  [3179] &quot;but not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked, twisted,&quot;         
##  [3180] &quot;blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, and&quot;     
##  [3181] &quot;flourishing.  I do not like ruined, tattered cottages.  I am not fond&quot;       
##  [3182] &quot;of nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in a&quot;       
##  [3183] &quot;snug farm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy, happy villages&quot;     
##  [3184] &quot;please me better than the finest banditti in the world.\&quot;&quot;                   
##  [3185] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3186] &quot;Marianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at her&quot;            
##  [3187] &quot;sister.  Elinor only laughed.&quot;                                               
##  [3188] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3189] &quot;The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remained&quot;                 
##  [3190] &quot;thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention.&quot;      
##  [3191] &quot;She was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood,&quot;        
##  [3192] &quot;his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait&quot;     
##  [3193] &quot;of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.&quot;              
##  [3194] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3195] &quot;\&quot;I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,\&quot; she cried.  \&quot;Is that&quot;       
##  [3196] &quot;Fanny&#39;s hair? I remember her promising to give you some.  But I should&quot;      
##  [3197] &quot;have thought her hair had been darker.\&quot;&quot;                                    
##  [3198] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3199] &quot;Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--but when she saw&quot;       
##  [3200] &quot;how much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of thought&quot;     
##  [3201] &quot;could not be surpassed by his.  He coloured very deeply, and giving a&quot;       
##  [3202] &quot;momentary glance at Elinor, replied, \&quot;Yes; it is my sister&#39;s hair.  The&quot;    
##  [3203] &quot;setting always casts a different shade on it, you know.\&quot;&quot;                   
##  [3204] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3205] &quot;Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise.  That the hair&quot;       
##  [3206] &quot;was her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne;&quot;        
##  [3207] &quot;the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne&quot;            
##  [3208] &quot;considered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must&quot;        
##  [3209] &quot;have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.&quot;         
##  [3210] &quot;She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and&quot;           
##  [3211] &quot;affecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of&quot;         
##  [3212] &quot;something else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch every&quot;         
##  [3213] &quot;opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all&quot;        
##  [3214] &quot;doubt, that it was exactly the shade of her own.&quot;                            
##  [3215] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3216] &quot;Edward&#39;s embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of&quot;      
##  [3217] &quot;mind still more settled.  He was particularly grave the whole morning.&quot;      
##  [3218] &quot;Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said; but her own&quot;       
##  [3219] &quot;forgiveness might have been more speedy, had she known how little&quot;           
##  [3220] &quot;offence it had given her sister.&quot;                                            
##  [3221] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3222] &quot;Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs.&quot;        
##  [3223] &quot;Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the&quot;            
##  [3224] &quot;cottage, came to take a survey of the guest.  With the assistance of&quot;        
##  [3225] &quot;his mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the name&quot;       
##  [3226] &quot;of Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of raillery&quot;     
##  [3227] &quot;against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of their&quot;          
##  [3228] &quot;acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediately&quot;        
##  [3229] &quot;sprung.  But, as it was, she only learned, from some very significant&quot;       
##  [3230] &quot;looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret&#39;s instructions,&quot;       
##  [3231] &quot;extended.&quot;                                                                   
##  [3232] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3233] &quot;Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to&quot;        
##  [3234] &quot;dine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening.&quot;      
##  [3235] &quot;On the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their visitor,&quot;     
##  [3236] &quot;towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute, he wished&quot;      
##  [3237] &quot;to engage them for both.&quot;                                                    
##  [3238] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3239] &quot;\&quot;You MUST drink tea with us to night,\&quot; said he, \&quot;for we shall be quite&quot;   
##  [3240] &quot;alone--and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we shall be a&quot;     
##  [3241] &quot;large party.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [3242] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3243] &quot;Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity.  \&quot;And who knows but you may raise&quot;    
##  [3244] &quot;a dance,\&quot; said she.  \&quot;And that will tempt YOU, Miss Marianne.\&quot;&quot;           
##  [3245] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3246] &quot;\&quot;A dance!\&quot; cried Marianne.  \&quot;Impossible! Who is to dance?\&quot;&quot;              
##  [3247] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3248] &quot;\&quot;Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to be sure.--What!&quot;     
##  [3249] &quot;you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be&quot;       
##  [3250] &quot;nameless is gone!\&quot;&quot;                                                         
##  [3251] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3252] &quot;\&quot;I wish with all my soul,\&quot; cried Sir John, \&quot;that Willoughby were among&quot;   
##  [3253] &quot;us again.\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [3254] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3255] &quot;This, and Marianne&#39;s blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward.  \&quot;And who&quot;    
##  [3256] &quot;is Willoughby?\&quot; said he, in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom he&quot;      
##  [3257] &quot;was sitting.&quot;                                                                
##  [3258] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3259] &quot;She gave him a brief reply.  Marianne&#39;s countenance was more&quot;                
##  [3260] &quot;communicative.  Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning&quot;       
##  [3261] &quot;of others, but such of Marianne&#39;s expressions as had puzzled him&quot;            
##  [3262] &quot;before; and when their visitors left them, he went immediately round&quot;        
##  [3263] &quot;her, and said, in a whisper, \&quot;I have been guessing.  Shall I tell you&quot;      
##  [3264] &quot;my guess?\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [3265] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3266] &quot;\&quot;What do you mean?\&quot;&quot;                                                       
##  [3267] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3268] &quot;\&quot;Shall I tell you.\&quot;&quot;                                                       
##  [3269] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3270] &quot;\&quot;Certainly.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [3271] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3272] &quot;\&quot;Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.\&quot;&quot;                           
##  [3273] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3274] &quot;Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling at&quot;      
##  [3275] &quot;the quiet archness of his manner, and after a moment&#39;s silence, said,&quot;       
##  [3276] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3277] &quot;\&quot;Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come I hope...I am sure&quot;       
##  [3278] &quot;you will like him.\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##  [3279] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3280] &quot;\&quot;I do not doubt it,\&quot; replied he, rather astonished at her earnestness&quot;     
##  [3281] &quot;and warmth; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her&quot;     
##  [3282] &quot;acquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothing&quot;           
##  [3283] &quot;between Mr. Willoughby and herself, he would not have ventured to&quot;           
##  [3284] &quot;mention it.&quot;                                                                 
##  [3285] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3286] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3287] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3288] &quot;CHAPTER 19&quot;                                                                  
##  [3289] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3290] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3291] &quot;Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs.&quot;     
##  [3292] &quot;Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only on&quot;                    
##  [3293] &quot;self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment&quot;        
##  [3294] &quot;among his friends was at the height.  His spirits, during the last two&quot;      
##  [3295] &quot;or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he&quot;         
##  [3296] &quot;grew more and more partial to the house and environs--never spoke of&quot;        
##  [3297] &quot;going away without a sigh--declared his time to be wholly&quot;                   
##  [3298] &quot;disengaged--even doubted to what place he should go when he left&quot;            
##  [3299] &quot;them--but still, go he must.  Never had any week passed so quickly--he&quot;      
##  [3300] &quot;could hardly believe it to be gone.  He said so repeatedly; other&quot;           
##  [3301] &quot;things he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the&quot;      
##  [3302] &quot;lie to his actions.  He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested being&quot;       
##  [3303] &quot;in town; but either to Norland or London, he must go.  He valued their&quot;      
##  [3304] &quot;kindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was in being with&quot;     
##  [3305] &quot;them.  Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of their&quot;      
##  [3306] &quot;wishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time.&quot;                  
##  [3307] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3308] &quot;Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his&quot;         
##  [3309] &quot;mother&#39;s account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose&quot;       
##  [3310] &quot;character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse&quot;      
##  [3311] &quot;for every thing strange on the part of her son.  Disappointed, however,&quot;     
##  [3312] &quot;and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain&quot;           
##  [3313] &quot;behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to regard&quot;     
##  [3314] &quot;his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,&quot;     
##  [3315] &quot;which had been rather more painfully extorted from her, for&quot;                 
##  [3316] &quot;Willoughby&#39;s service, by her mother.  His want of spirits, of openness,&quot;     
##  [3317] &quot;and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want of&quot;             
##  [3318] &quot;independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s disposition&quot;        
##  [3319] &quot;and designs.  The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose&quot;     
##  [3320] &quot;in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the same&quot;      
##  [3321] &quot;inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.  The old&quot;               
##  [3322] &quot;well-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child,&quot;      
##  [3323] &quot;was the cause of all.  She would have been glad to know when these&quot;          
##  [3324] &quot;difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs.&quot;        
##  [3325] &quot;Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.  But&quot;      
##  [3326] &quot;from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal&quot;     
##  [3327] &quot;of her confidence in Edward&#39;s affection, to the remembrance of every&quot;        
##  [3328] &quot;mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton, and&quot;     
##  [3329] &quot;above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round&quot;     
##  [3330] &quot;his finger.&quot;                                                                 
##  [3331] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3332] &quot;\&quot;I think, Edward,\&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the&quot;      
##  [3333] &quot;last morning, \&quot;you would be a happier man if you had any profession to&quot;     
##  [3334] &quot;engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions.  Some&quot;      
##  [3335] &quot;inconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you would&quot;      
##  [3336] &quot;not be able to give them so much of your time.  But (with a smile) you&quot;      
##  [3337] &quot;would be materially benefited in one particular at least--you would&quot;         
##  [3338] &quot;know where to go when you left them.\&quot;&quot;                                      
##  [3339] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3340] &quot;\&quot;I do assure you,\&quot; he replied, \&quot;that I have long thought on this point,&quot;  
##  [3341] &quot;as you think now.  It has been, and is, and probably will always be a&quot;       
##  [3342] &quot;heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage&quot;     
##  [3343] &quot;me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing like&quot;        
##  [3344] &quot;independence.  But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of my&quot;        
##  [3345] &quot;friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being.  We never&quot;         
##  [3346] &quot;could agree in our choice of a profession.  I always preferred the&quot;          
##  [3347] &quot;church, as I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family.&quot;        
##  [3348] &quot;They recommended the army.  That was a great deal too smart for me.&quot;         
##  [3349] &quot;The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had&quot;           
##  [3350] &quot;chambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first&quot;            
##  [3351] &quot;circles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had no&quot;           
##  [3352] &quot;inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which&quot;      
##  [3353] &quot;my family approved.  As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I&quot;     
##  [3354] &quot;was too old when the subject was first started to enter it--and, at&quot;         
##  [3355] &quot;length, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all,&quot;      
##  [3356] &quot;as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as&quot;     
##  [3357] &quot;with one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous&quot;      
##  [3358] &quot;and honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so&quot;            
##  [3359] &quot;earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his&quot;          
##  [3360] &quot;friends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been&quot;     
##  [3361] &quot;properly idle ever since.\&quot;&quot;                                                 
##  [3362] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3363] &quot;\&quot;The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,\&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood,&quot;       
##  [3364] &quot;\&quot;since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons will&quot;    
##  [3365] &quot;be brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades&quot;     
##  [3366] &quot;as Columella&#39;s.\&quot;&quot;                                                           
##  [3367] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3368] &quot;\&quot;They will be brought up,\&quot; said he, in a serious accent, \&quot;to be as&quot;       
##  [3369] &quot;unlike myself as is possible.  In feeling, in action, in condition, in&quot;      
##  [3370] &quot;every thing.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [3371] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3372] &quot;\&quot;Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits,&quot;         
##  [3373] &quot;Edward.  You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike&quot;      
##  [3374] &quot;yourself must be happy.  But remember that the pain of parting from&quot;         
##  [3375] &quot;friends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their&quot;              
##  [3376] &quot;education or state.  Know your own happiness.  You want nothing but&quot;         
##  [3377] &quot;patience--or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope.  Your&quot;           
##  [3378] &quot;mother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so&quot;            
##  [3379] &quot;anxious for; it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her&quot;       
##  [3380] &quot;happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.&quot;      
##  [3381] &quot;How much may not a few months do?\&quot;&quot;                                         
##  [3382] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3383] &quot;\&quot;I think,\&quot; replied Edward, \&quot;that I may defy many months to produce any&quot;   
##  [3384] &quot;good to me.\&quot;&quot;                                                               
##  [3385] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3386] &quot;This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to&quot;        
##  [3387] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which&quot;       
##  [3388] &quot;shortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor&#39;s&quot;        
##  [3389] &quot;feelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.&quot;        
##  [3390] &quot;But as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself&quot;        
##  [3391] &quot;from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his&quot;      
##  [3392] &quot;going away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by&quot;         
##  [3393] &quot;Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by&quot;          
##  [3394] &quot;seeking silence, solitude and idleness.  Their means were as different&quot;      
##  [3395] &quot;as their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.&quot;            
##  [3396] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3397] &quot;Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the&quot;           
##  [3398] &quot;house, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor&quot;            
##  [3399] &quot;avoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost as&quot;     
##  [3400] &quot;much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this&quot;         
##  [3401] &quot;conduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented&quot;        
##  [3402] &quot;from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much&quot;      
##  [3403] &quot;solicitude on her account.&quot;                                                  
##  [3404] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3405] &quot;Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no&quot;      
##  [3406] &quot;more meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her.&quot;        
##  [3407] &quot;The business of self-command she settled very easily;--with strong&quot;          
##  [3408] &quot;affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.&quot;        
##  [3409] &quot;That her sister&#39;s affections WERE calm, she dared not deny, though she&quot;      
##  [3410] &quot;blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she gave a&quot;       
##  [3411] &quot;very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that sister, in&quot;         
##  [3412] &quot;spite of this mortifying conviction.&quot;                                        
##  [3413] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3414] &quot;Without shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house in&quot;        
##  [3415] &quot;determined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to&quot;        
##  [3416] &quot;indulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough&quot;      
##  [3417] &quot;to think of Edward, and of Edward&#39;s behaviour, in every possible&quot;            
##  [3418] &quot;variety which the different state of her spirits at different times&quot;         
##  [3419] &quot;could produce,--with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.&quot;     
##  [3420] &quot;There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her&quot;         
##  [3421] &quot;mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,&quot;            
##  [3422] &quot;conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude was&quot;     
##  [3423] &quot;produced.  Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could not&quot;       
##  [3424] &quot;be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so&quot;          
##  [3425] &quot;interesting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross&quot;      
##  [3426] &quot;her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.&quot;                                  
##  [3427] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3428] &quot;From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawing-table, she was&quot;       
##  [3429] &quot;roused one morning, soon after Edward&#39;s leaving them, by the arrival of&quot;     
##  [3430] &quot;company.  She happened to be quite alone.  The closing of the little&quot;        
##  [3431] &quot;gate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew&quot;        
##  [3432] &quot;her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the&quot;         
##  [3433] &quot;door.  Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,&quot;     
##  [3434] &quot;but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite unknown&quot;     
##  [3435] &quot;to her.  She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir John&quot;           
##  [3436] &quot;perceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of&quot;             
##  [3437] &quot;knocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open&quot;     
##  [3438] &quot;the casement to speak to him, though the space was so short between the&quot;     
##  [3439] &quot;door and the window, as to make it hardly possible to speak at one&quot;          
##  [3440] &quot;without being heard at the other.&quot;                                           
##  [3441] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3442] &quot;\&quot;Well,\&quot; said he, \&quot;we have brought you some strangers.  How do you like&quot;   
##  [3443] &quot;them?\&quot;&quot;                                                                     
##  [3444] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3445] &quot;\&quot;Hush! they will hear you.\&quot;&quot;                                               
##  [3446] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3447] &quot;\&quot;Never mind if they do.  It is only the Palmers.  Charlotte is very&quot;        
##  [3448] &quot;pretty, I can tell you.  You may see her if you look this way.\&quot;&quot;            
##  [3449] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3450] &quot;As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, without&quot;         
##  [3451] &quot;taking that liberty, she begged to be excused.&quot;                              
##  [3452] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3453] &quot;\&quot;Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we are come? I see her&quot;        
##  [3454] &quot;instrument is open.\&quot;&quot;                                                       
##  [3455] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3456] &quot;\&quot;She is walking, I believe.\&quot;&quot;                                              
##  [3457] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3458] &quot;They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough to&quot;       
##  [3459] &quot;wait till the door was opened before she told HER story.  She came&quot;          
##  [3460] &quot;hallooing to the window, \&quot;How do you do, my dear?  How does Mrs.&quot;           
##  [3461] &quot;Dashwood do?  And where are your sisters?  What! all alone! you will be&quot;     
##  [3462] &quot;glad of a little company to sit with you.  I have brought my other son&quot;      
##  [3463] &quot;and daughter to see you.  Only think of their coming so suddenly!  I&quot;        
##  [3464] &quot;thought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,&quot;      
##  [3465] &quot;but it never entered my head that it could be them.  I thought of&quot;           
##  [3466] &quot;nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again; so&quot;     
##  [3467] &quot;I said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel&quot;     
##  [3468] &quot;Brandon come back again\&quot;--&quot;                                                 
##  [3469] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3470] &quot;Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, to&quot;         
##  [3471] &quot;receive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the two&quot;            
##  [3472] &quot;strangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same&quot;          
##  [3473] &quot;time, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings&quot;     
##  [3474] &quot;continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour,&quot;     
##  [3475] &quot;attended by Sir John.&quot;                                                       
##  [3476] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3477] &quot;Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally&quot;      
##  [3478] &quot;unlike her in every respect.  She was short and plump, had a very&quot;           
##  [3479] &quot;pretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could&quot;      
##  [3480] &quot;possibly be.  Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister&#39;s,&quot;      
##  [3481] &quot;but they were much more prepossessing.  She came in with a smile,&quot;           
##  [3482] &quot;smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled&quot;       
##  [3483] &quot;when she went away.  Her husband was a grave looking young man of five&quot;      
##  [3484] &quot;or six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife,&quot;     
##  [3485] &quot;but of less willingness to please or be pleased.  He entered the room&quot;       
##  [3486] &quot;with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without&quot;      
##  [3487] &quot;speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their&quot;                
##  [3488] &quot;apartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read&quot;       
##  [3489] &quot;it as long as he staid.&quot;                                                     
##  [3490] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3491] &quot;Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with a&quot;     
##  [3492] &quot;turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before her&quot;      
##  [3493] &quot;admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.&quot;                
##  [3494] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3495] &quot;\&quot;Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so&quot;             
##  [3496] &quot;charming!  Only think, Mama, how it is improved since I was here last!&quot;      
##  [3497] &quot;I always thought it such a sweet place, ma&#39;am! (turning to Mrs.&quot;             
##  [3498] &quot;Dashwood) but you have made it so charming!  Only look, sister, how&quot;         
##  [3499] &quot;delightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself!&quot;       
##  [3500] &quot;Should not you, Mr. Palmer?\&quot;&quot;                                               
##  [3501] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3502] &quot;Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from the&quot;     
##  [3503] &quot;newspaper.&quot;                                                                  
##  [3504] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3505] &quot;\&quot;Mr. Palmer does not hear me,\&quot; said she, laughing; \&quot;he never does&quot;        
##  [3506] &quot;sometimes.  It is so ridiculous!\&quot;&quot;                                          
##  [3507] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3508] &quot;This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used to&quot;      
##  [3509] &quot;find wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking with&quot;     
##  [3510] &quot;surprise at them both.&quot;                                                      
##  [3511] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3512] &quot;Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she could, and&quot;         
##  [3513] &quot;continued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing&quot;      
##  [3514] &quot;their friends, without ceasing till every thing was told.  Mrs. Palmer&quot;      
##  [3515] &quot;laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every&quot;       
##  [3516] &quot;body agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite an&quot;             
##  [3517] &quot;agreeable surprise.&quot;                                                         
##  [3518] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3519] &quot;\&quot;You may believe how glad we all were to see them,\&quot; added Mrs.&quot;            
##  [3520] &quot;Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice&quot;       
##  [3521] &quot;as if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on&quot;      
##  [3522] &quot;different sides of the room; \&quot;but, however, I can&#39;t help wishing they&quot;      
##  [3523] &quot;had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it,&quot;        
##  [3524] &quot;for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for&quot;        
##  [3525] &quot;you know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was&quot;        
##  [3526] &quot;wrong in her situation.  I wanted her to stay at home and rest this&quot;         
##  [3527] &quot;morning, but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you all!\&quot;&quot;   
##  [3528] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3529] &quot;Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her any harm.&quot;                 
##  [3530] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3531] &quot;\&quot;She expects to be confined in February,\&quot; continued Mrs. Jennings.&quot;        
##  [3532] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3533] &quot;Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, and&quot;              
##  [3534] &quot;therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in&quot;        
##  [3535] &quot;the paper.&quot;                                                                  
##  [3536] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3537] &quot;\&quot;No, none at all,\&quot; he replied, and read on.&quot;                               
##  [3538] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3539] &quot;\&quot;Here comes Marianne,\&quot; cried Sir John.  \&quot;Now, Palmer, you shall see a&quot;    
##  [3540] &quot;monstrous pretty girl.\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [3541] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3542] &quot;He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and&quot;            
##  [3543] &quot;ushered her in himself.  Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as she&quot;            
##  [3544] &quot;appeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so&quot;       
##  [3545] &quot;heartily at the question, as to show she understood it.  Mr. Palmer&quot;         
##  [3546] &quot;looked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and&quot;         
##  [3547] &quot;then returned to his newspaper.  Mrs. Palmer&#39;s eye was now caught by&quot;        
##  [3548] &quot;the drawings which hung round the room.  She got up to examine them.&quot;        
##  [3549] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3550] &quot;\&quot;Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!  Well! how delightful!  Do but&quot;         
##  [3551] &quot;look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could look&quot;      
##  [3552] &quot;at them for ever.\&quot; And then sitting down again, she very soon forgot&quot;       
##  [3553] &quot;that there were any such things in the room.&quot;                                
##  [3554] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3555] &quot;When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid down&quot;        
##  [3556] &quot;the newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around.&quot;             
##  [3557] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3558] &quot;\&quot;My love, have you been asleep?\&quot; said his wife, laughing.&quot;                 
##  [3559] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3560] &quot;He made her no answer; and only observed, after again examining the&quot;         
##  [3561] &quot;room, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked.&quot;       
##  [3562] &quot;He then made his bow, and departed with the rest.&quot;                           
##  [3563] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3564] &quot;Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at&quot;        
##  [3565] &quot;the park.  Mrs. Dashwood, who did not chuse to dine with them oftener&quot;       
##  [3566] &quot;than they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;&quot;      
##  [3567] &quot;her daughters might do as they pleased.  But they had no curiosity to&quot;       
##  [3568] &quot;see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of&quot;         
##  [3569] &quot;pleasure from them in any other way.  They attempted, therefore,&quot;            
##  [3570] &quot;likewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and not&quot;          
##  [3571] &quot;likely to be good.  But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage&quot;       
##  [3572] &quot;should be sent for them and they must come.  Lady Middleton too, though&quot;     
##  [3573] &quot;she did not press their mother, pressed them.  Mrs. Jennings and Mrs.&quot;       
##  [3574] &quot;Palmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid a&quot;       
##  [3575] &quot;family party; and the young ladies were obliged to yield.&quot;                   
##  [3576] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3577] &quot;\&quot;Why should they ask us?\&quot; said Marianne, as soon as they were gone.&quot;       
##  [3578] &quot;\&quot;The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very&quot;        
##  [3579] &quot;hard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying&quot;       
##  [3580] &quot;either with them, or with us.\&quot;&quot;                                             
##  [3581] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3582] &quot;\&quot;They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;by&quot;     
##  [3583] &quot;these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them a&quot;     
##  [3584] &quot;few weeks ago.  The alteration is not in them, if their parties are&quot;         
##  [3585] &quot;grown tedious and dull.  We must look for the change elsewhere.\&quot;&quot;           
##  [3586] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3587] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3588] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3589] &quot;CHAPTER 20&quot;                                                                  
##  [3590] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3591] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3592] &quot;As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next&quot;         
##  [3593] &quot;day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as&quot;      
##  [3594] &quot;good humoured and merry as before.  She took them all most&quot;                  
##  [3595] &quot;affectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing them&quot;      
##  [3596] &quot;again.&quot;                                                                      
##  [3597] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3598] &quot;\&quot;I am so glad to see you!\&quot; said she, seating herself between Elinor and&quot;   
##  [3599] &quot;Marianne, \&quot;for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come,&quot;         
##  [3600] &quot;which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must&quot;      
##  [3601] &quot;go, for the Westons come to us next week you know.  It was quite a&quot;          
##  [3602] &quot;sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the&quot;           
##  [3603] &quot;carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I&quot;          
##  [3604] &quot;would go with him to Barton.  He is so droll! He never tells me any&quot;         
##  [3605] &quot;thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet again&quot;     
##  [3606] &quot;in town very soon, I hope.\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [3607] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3608] &quot;They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.&quot;                     
##  [3609] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3610] &quot;\&quot;Not go to town!\&quot; cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, \&quot;I shall be quite&quot;     
##  [3611] &quot;disappointed if you do not.  I could get the nicest house in the world for&quot;  
##  [3612] &quot;you, next door to ours, in Hanover-square.  You must come, indeed.  I&quot;       
##  [3613] &quot;am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am&quot;         
##  [3614] &quot;confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public.\&quot;&quot;             
##  [3615] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3616] &quot;They thanked her; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties.&quot;            
##  [3617] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3618] &quot;\&quot;Oh, my love,\&quot; cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband, who just then entered&quot;    
##  [3619] &quot;the room--\&quot;you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to&quot;        
##  [3620] &quot;town this winter.\&quot;&quot;                                                         
##  [3621] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3622] &quot;Her love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies, began&quot;     
##  [3623] &quot;complaining of the weather.&quot;                                                 
##  [3624] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3625] &quot;\&quot;How horrid all this is!\&quot; said he.  \&quot;Such weather makes every thing and&quot;  
##  [3626] &quot;every body disgusting.  Dullness is as much produced within doors as&quot;        
##  [3627] &quot;without, by rain.  It makes one detest all one&#39;s acquaintance.  What&quot;        
##  [3628] &quot;the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his&quot;           
##  [3629] &quot;house?  How few people know what comfort is!  Sir John is as stupid as&quot;      
##  [3630] &quot;the weather.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [3631] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3632] &quot;The rest of the company soon dropt in.&quot;                                      
##  [3633] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3634] &quot;\&quot;I am afraid, Miss Marianne,\&quot; said Sir John, \&quot;you have not been able to&quot;  
##  [3635] &quot;take your usual walk to Allenham today.\&quot;&quot;                                   
##  [3636] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3637] &quot;Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.&quot;                                
##  [3638] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3639] &quot;\&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be so sly before us,\&quot; said Mrs. Palmer; \&quot;for we know all&quot;      
##  [3640] &quot;about it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think&quot;      
##  [3641] &quot;he is extremely handsome.  We do not live a great way from him in the&quot;       
##  [3642] &quot;country, you know.  Not above ten miles, I dare say.\&quot;&quot;                      
##  [3643] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3644] &quot;\&quot;Much nearer thirty,\&quot; said her husband.&quot;                                   
##  [3645] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3646] &quot;\&quot;Ah, well! there is not much difference.  I never was at his house; but&quot;    
##  [3647] &quot;they say it is a sweet pretty place.\&quot;&quot;                                      
##  [3648] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3649] &quot;\&quot;As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,\&quot; said Mr. Palmer.&quot;               
##  [3650] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3651] &quot;Marianne remained perfectly silent, though her countenance betrayed her&quot;     
##  [3652] &quot;interest in what was said.&quot;                                                  
##  [3653] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3654] &quot;\&quot;Is it very ugly?\&quot; continued Mrs. Palmer--\&quot;then it must be some other&quot;    
##  [3655] &quot;place that is so pretty I suppose.\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [3656] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3657] &quot;When they were seated in the dining room, Sir John observed with regret&quot;     
##  [3658] &quot;that they were only eight all together.&quot;                                     
##  [3659] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3660] &quot;\&quot;My dear,\&quot; said he to his lady, \&quot;it is very provoking that we should be&quot;  
##  [3661] &quot;so few.  Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today?\&quot;&quot;            
##  [3662] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3663] &quot;\&quot;Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before,&quot;       
##  [3664] &quot;that it could not be done?  They dined with us last.\&quot;&quot;                      
##  [3665] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3666] &quot;\&quot;You and I, Sir John,\&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, \&quot;should not stand upon such&quot;   
##  [3667] &quot;ceremony.\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [3668] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3669] &quot;\&quot;Then you would be very ill-bred,\&quot; cried Mr. Palmer.&quot;                      
##  [3670] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3671] &quot;\&quot;My love you contradict every body,\&quot; said his wife with her usual&quot;         
##  [3672] &quot;laugh.  \&quot;Do you know that you are quite rude?\&quot;&quot;                            
##  [3673] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3674] &quot;\&quot;I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother&quot;             
##  [3675] &quot;ill-bred.\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [3676] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3677] &quot;\&quot;Ay, you may abuse me as you please,\&quot; said the good-natured old lady,&quot;     
##  [3678] &quot;\&quot;you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back again.&quot;    
##  [3679] &quot;So there I have the whip hand of you.\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [3680] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3681] &quot;Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid&quot;      
##  [3682] &quot;of her; and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her,&quot;      
##  [3683] &quot;as they must live together.  It was impossible for any one to be more&quot;       
##  [3684] &quot;thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs.&quot;           
##  [3685] &quot;Palmer.  The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of her&quot;         
##  [3686] &quot;husband gave her no pain; and when he scolded or abused her, she was&quot;        
##  [3687] &quot;highly diverted.&quot;                                                            
##  [3688] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3689] &quot;\&quot;Mr. Palmer is so droll!\&quot; said she, in a whisper, to Elinor.  \&quot;He is&quot;     
##  [3690] &quot;always out of humour.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##  [3691] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3692] &quot;Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him credit&quot;     
##  [3693] &quot;for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he&quot;       
##  [3694] &quot;wished to appear.  His temper might perhaps be a little soured by&quot;           
##  [3695] &quot;finding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable&quot;       
##  [3696] &quot;bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly&quot;                
##  [3697] &quot;woman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any&quot;       
##  [3698] &quot;sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.-- It was rather a wish of&quot;          
##  [3699] &quot;distinction, she believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment of&quot;     
##  [3700] &quot;every body, and his general abuse of every thing before him.  It was&quot;        
##  [3701] &quot;the desire of appearing superior to other people.  The motive was too&quot;       
##  [3702] &quot;common to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed by&quot;      
##  [3703] &quot;establishing his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach&quot;     
##  [3704] &quot;any one to him except his wife.&quot;                                             
##  [3705] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3706] &quot;\&quot;Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,\&quot; said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, \&quot;I have&quot;   
##  [3707] &quot;got such a favour to ask of you and your sister.  Will you come and&quot;         
##  [3708] &quot;spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas?  Now, pray do,--and come&quot;       
##  [3709] &quot;while the Westons are with us.  You cannot think how happy I shall be!&quot;      
##  [3710] &quot;It will be quite delightful!--My love,\&quot; applying to her husband, \&quot;don&#39;t&quot;   
##  [3711] &quot;you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?\&quot;&quot;                    
##  [3712] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3713] &quot;\&quot;Certainly,\&quot; he replied, with a sneer--\&quot;I came into Devonshire with no&quot;   
##  [3714] &quot;other view.\&quot;&quot;                                                               
##  [3715] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3716] &quot;\&quot;There now,\&quot;--said his lady, \&quot;you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you&quot;     
##  [3717] &quot;cannot refuse to come.\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [3718] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3719] &quot;They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.&quot;                   
##  [3720] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3721] &quot;\&quot;But indeed you must and shall come.  I am sure you will like it of all&quot;    
##  [3722] &quot;things.  The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful.&quot;      
##  [3723] &quot;You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay&quot;         
##  [3724] &quot;now, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing&quot;            
##  [3725] &quot;against the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I&quot;        
##  [3726] &quot;never saw before, it is quite charming!  But, poor fellow! it is very&quot;       
##  [3727] &quot;fatiguing to him! for he is forced to make every body like him.\&quot;&quot;           
##  [3728] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3729] &quot;Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the&quot;             
##  [3730] &quot;hardship of such an obligation.&quot;                                             
##  [3731] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3732] &quot;\&quot;How charming it will be,\&quot; said Charlotte, \&quot;when he is in&quot;                
##  [3733] &quot;Parliament!--won&#39;t it? How I shall laugh!  It will be so ridiculous to&quot;      
##  [3734] &quot;see all his letters directed to him with an M.P.--But do you know, he&quot;       
##  [3735] &quot;says, he will never frank for me?  He declares he won&#39;t.  Don&#39;t you,&quot;        
##  [3736] &quot;Mr. Palmer?\&quot;&quot;                                                               
##  [3737] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3738] &quot;Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.&quot;                                           
##  [3739] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3740] &quot;\&quot;He cannot bear writing, you know,\&quot; she continued--\&quot;he says it is quite&quot;  
##  [3741] &quot;shocking.\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [3742] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3743] &quot;\&quot;No,\&quot; said he, \&quot;I never said any thing so irrational.  Don&#39;t palm all&quot;    
##  [3744] &quot;your abuses of languages upon me.\&quot;&quot;                                         
##  [3745] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3746] &quot;\&quot;There now; you see how droll he is.  This is always the way with him!&quot;     
##  [3747] &quot;Sometimes he won&#39;t speak to me for half a day together, and then he&quot;         
##  [3748] &quot;comes out with something so droll--all about any thing in the world.\&quot;&quot;      
##  [3749] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3750] &quot;She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room,&quot;      
##  [3751] &quot;by asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.&quot;              
##  [3752] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3753] &quot;\&quot;Certainly,\&quot; said Elinor; \&quot;he seems very agreeable.\&quot;&quot;                    
##  [3754] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3755] &quot;\&quot;Well--I am so glad you do.  I thought you would, he is so pleasant;&quot;       
##  [3756] &quot;and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can&quot;       
##  [3757] &quot;tell you, and you can&#39;t think how disappointed he will be if you don&#39;t&quot;      
##  [3758] &quot;come to Cleveland.--I can&#39;t imagine why you should object to it.\&quot;&quot;          
##  [3759] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3760] &quot;Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing the&quot;     
##  [3761] &quot;subject, put a stop to her entreaties.  She thought it probable that as&quot;     
##  [3762] &quot;they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some&quot;       
##  [3763] &quot;more particular account of Willoughby&#39;s general character, than could&quot;       
##  [3764] &quot;be gathered from the Middletons&#39; partial acquaintance with him; and she&quot;     
##  [3765] &quot;was eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of his merits as&quot;        
##  [3766] &quot;might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne.  She began by&quot;           
##  [3767] &quot;inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland, and whether&quot;      
##  [3768] &quot;they were intimately acquainted with him.&quot;                                   
##  [3769] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3770] &quot;\&quot;Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,\&quot; replied Mrs. Palmer;--\&quot;Not&quot;    
##  [3771] &quot;that I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.&quot;     
##  [3772] &quot;Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was&quot;      
##  [3773] &quot;at Allenham.  Mama saw him here once before;--but I was with my uncle&quot;       
##  [3774] &quot;at Weymouth.  However, I dare say we should have seen a great deal of&quot;       
##  [3775] &quot;him in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily that we&quot;         
##  [3776] &quot;should never have been in the country together.  He is very little at&quot;       
##  [3777] &quot;Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do not think Mr.&quot;     
##  [3778] &quot;Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you know, and&quot;          
##  [3779] &quot;besides it is such a way off.  I know why you inquire about him, very&quot;       
##  [3780] &quot;well; your sister is to marry him.  I am monstrous glad of it, for then&quot;     
##  [3781] &quot;I shall have her for a neighbour you know.\&quot;&quot;                                
##  [3782] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3783] &quot;\&quot;Upon my word,\&quot; replied Elinor, \&quot;you know much more of the matter than&quot;   
##  [3784] &quot;I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match.\&quot;&quot;                      
##  [3785] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3786] &quot;\&quot;Don&#39;t pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body talks&quot;    
##  [3787] &quot;of.  I assure you I heard of it in my way through town.\&quot;&quot;                   
##  [3788] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3789] &quot;\&quot;My dear Mrs. Palmer!\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [3790] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3791] &quot;\&quot;Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in&quot;            
##  [3792] &quot;Bond-street, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly.\&quot;&quot;     
##  [3793] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3794] &quot;\&quot;You surprise me very much.  Colonel Brandon tell you of it!  Surely&quot;       
##  [3795] &quot;you must be mistaken.  To give such intelligence to a person who could&quot;      
##  [3796] &quot;not be interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should&quot;         
##  [3797] &quot;expect Colonel Brandon to do.\&quot;&quot;                                             
##  [3798] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3799] &quot;\&quot;But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how&quot;      
##  [3800] &quot;it happened.  When we met him, he turned back and walked with us; and&quot;       
##  [3801] &quot;so we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and&quot;             
##  [3802] &quot;another, and I said to him, &#39;So, Colonel, there is a new family come to&quot;     
##  [3803] &quot;Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very pretty,&quot;        
##  [3804] &quot;and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe&quot;      
##  [3805] &quot;Magna.  Is it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you have been&quot;     
##  [3806] &quot;in Devonshire so lately.&#39;\&quot;&quot;                                                 
##  [3807] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3808] &quot;\&quot;And what did the Colonel say?\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [3809] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3810] &quot;\&quot;Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true, so&quot;    
##  [3811] &quot;from that moment I set it down as certain.  It will be quite&quot;                
##  [3812] &quot;delightful, I declare!  When is it to take place?\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [3813] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3814] &quot;\&quot;Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [3815] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3816] &quot;\&quot;Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing but&quot;      
##  [3817] &quot;say fine things of you.\&quot;&quot;                                                   
##  [3818] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3819] &quot;\&quot;I am flattered by his commendation.  He seems an excellent man; and I&quot;     
##  [3820] &quot;think him uncommonly pleasing.\&quot;&quot;                                            
##  [3821] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3822] &quot;\&quot;So do I.--He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should&quot;    
##  [3823] &quot;be so grave and so dull.  Mama says HE was in love with your sister&quot;         
##  [3824] &quot;too.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly&quot;      
##  [3825] &quot;ever falls in love with any body.\&quot;&quot;                                         
##  [3826] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3827] &quot;\&quot;Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?\&quot; said&quot;        
##  [3828] &quot;Elinor.&quot;                                                                     
##  [3829] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3830] &quot;\&quot;Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are&quot;        
##  [3831] &quot;acquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all&quot;        
##  [3832] &quot;think him extremely agreeable I assure you.  Nobody is more liked than&quot;      
##  [3833] &quot;Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.  She&quot;      
##  [3834] &quot;is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he&quot;       
##  [3835] &quot;is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and&quot;      
##  [3836] &quot;agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her.  However, I don&#39;t&quot;       
##  [3837] &quot;think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think&quot;       
##  [3838] &quot;you both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,&quot;          
##  [3839] &quot;though we could not get him to own it last night.\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [3840] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3841] &quot;Mrs. Palmer&#39;s information respecting Willoughby was not very material;&quot;      
##  [3842] &quot;but any testimony in his favour, however small, was pleasing to her.&quot;        
##  [3843] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3844] &quot;\&quot;I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,\&quot; continued&quot;                   
##  [3845] &quot;Charlotte.--\&quot;And now I hope we shall always be great friends.  You&quot;         
##  [3846] &quot;can&#39;t think how much I longed to see you!  It is so delightful that you&quot;     
##  [3847] &quot;should live at the cottage!  Nothing can be like it, to be sure!  And I&quot;     
##  [3848] &quot;am so glad your sister is going to be well married!  I hope you will be&quot;     
##  [3849] &quot;a great deal at Combe Magna.  It is a sweet place, by all accounts.\&quot;&quot;       
##  [3850] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3851] &quot;\&quot;You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?\&quot;&quot;       
##  [3852] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3853] &quot;\&quot;Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married.-- He was a&quot;              
##  [3854] &quot;particular friend of Sir John&#39;s. I believe,\&quot; she added in a low voice,&quot;     
##  [3855] &quot;\&quot;he would have been very glad to have had me, if he could.  Sir John&quot;       
##  [3856] &quot;and Lady Middleton wished it very much.  But mama did not think the&quot;         
##  [3857] &quot;match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to&quot;     
##  [3858] &quot;the Colonel, and we should have been married immediately.\&quot;&quot;                 
##  [3859] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3860] &quot;\&quot;Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John&#39;s proposal to your mother&quot;        
##  [3861] &quot;before it was made?  Had he never owned his affection to yourself?\&quot;&quot;        
##  [3862] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3863] &quot;\&quot;Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have&quot;      
##  [3864] &quot;liked it of all things.  He had not seen me then above twice, for it&quot;        
##  [3865] &quot;was before I left school.  However, I am much happier as I am.  Mr.&quot;         
##  [3866] &quot;Palmer is the kind of man I like.\&quot;&quot;                                         
##  [3867] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3868] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3869] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3870] &quot;CHAPTER 21&quot;                                                                  
##  [3871] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3872] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3873] &quot;The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families at&quot;     
##  [3874] &quot;Barton were again left to entertain each other.  But this did not last&quot;      
##  [3875] &quot;long; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head, had&quot;        
##  [3876] &quot;hardly done wondering at Charlotte&#39;s being so happy without a cause, at&quot;     
##  [3877] &quot;Mr. Palmer&#39;s acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strange&quot;      
##  [3878] &quot;unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before Sir&quot;     
##  [3879] &quot;John&#39;s and Mrs. Jennings&#39;s active zeal in the cause of society,&quot;             
##  [3880] &quot;procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe.&quot;                
##  [3881] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3882] &quot;In a morning&#39;s excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young ladies,&quot;     
##  [3883] &quot;whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her&quot;            
##  [3884] &quot;relations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to&quot;      
##  [3885] &quot;the park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.&quot;         
##  [3886] &quot;Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an&quot;               
##  [3887] &quot;invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the&quot;       
##  [3888] &quot;return of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive a&quot;          
##  [3889] &quot;visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose&quot;      
##  [3890] &quot;elegance,--whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof; for&quot;     
##  [3891] &quot;the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for&quot;           
##  [3892] &quot;nothing at all.  Their being her relations too made it so much the&quot;          
##  [3893] &quot;worse; and Mrs. Jennings&#39;s attempts at consolation were therefore&quot;           
##  [3894] &quot;unfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about&quot;      
##  [3895] &quot;their being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put&quot;      
##  [3896] &quot;up with one another.  As it was impossible, however, now to prevent&quot;         
##  [3897] &quot;their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with&quot;       
##  [3898] &quot;all the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with merely&quot;     
##  [3899] &quot;giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times&quot;      
##  [3900] &quot;every day.&quot;                                                                  
##  [3901] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3902] &quot;The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel or&quot;     
##  [3903] &quot;unfashionable.  Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil,&quot;       
##  [3904] &quot;they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,&quot;     
##  [3905] &quot;and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady&quot;             
##  [3906] &quot;Middleton&#39;s good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had&quot;        
##  [3907] &quot;been an hour at the Park.  She declared them to be very agreeable girls&quot;     
##  [3908] &quot;indeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.  Sir John&#39;s&quot;     
##  [3909] &quot;confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise, and he&quot;       
##  [3910] &quot;set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss&quot;     
##  [3911] &quot;Steeles&#39; arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls&quot;      
##  [3912] &quot;in the world.  From such commendation as this, however, there was not&quot;       
##  [3913] &quot;much to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the&quot;         
##  [3914] &quot;world were to be met with in every part of England, under every&quot;             
##  [3915] &quot;possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding.  Sir John&quot;       
##  [3916] &quot;wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his&quot;        
##  [3917] &quot;guests.  Benevolent, philanthropic man!  It was painful to him even to&quot;      
##  [3918] &quot;keep a third cousin to himself.&quot;                                             
##  [3919] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3920] &quot;\&quot;Do come now,\&quot; said he--\&quot;pray come--you must come--I declare you shall&quot;   
##  [3921] &quot;come--You can&#39;t think how you will like them.  Lucy is monstrous&quot;            
##  [3922] &quot;pretty, and so good humoured and agreeable!  The children are all&quot;           
##  [3923] &quot;hanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance.  And they&quot;     
##  [3924] &quot;both long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that&quot;      
##  [3925] &quot;you are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told them&quot;     
##  [3926] &quot;it is all very true, and a great deal more.  You will be delighted with&quot;     
##  [3927] &quot;them I am sure.  They have brought the whole coach full of playthings&quot;       
##  [3928] &quot;for the children.  How can you be so cross as not to come?  Why they&quot;        
##  [3929] &quot;are your cousins, you know, after a fashion.  YOU are my cousins, and&quot;       
##  [3930] &quot;they are my wife&#39;s, so you must be related.\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [3931] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3932] &quot;But Sir John could not prevail.  He could only obtain a promise of&quot;          
##  [3933] &quot;their calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in&quot;        
##  [3934] &quot;amazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their&quot;       
##  [3935] &quot;attractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the&quot;     
##  [3936] &quot;Miss Steeles to them.&quot;                                                       
##  [3937] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3938] &quot;When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to&quot;        
##  [3939] &quot;these young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of the&quot;          
##  [3940] &quot;eldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensible&quot;         
##  [3941] &quot;face, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two or&quot;     
##  [3942] &quot;three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her features&quot;       
##  [3943] &quot;were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness of air,&quot;         
##  [3944] &quot;which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave distinction&quot;     
##  [3945] &quot;to her person.-- Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon&quot;     
##  [3946] &quot;allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw with what&quot;          
##  [3947] &quot;constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable&quot;      
##  [3948] &quot;to Lady Middleton.  With her children they were in continual raptures,&quot;      
##  [3949] &quot;extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their&quot;          
##  [3950] &quot;whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate&quot;       
##  [3951] &quot;demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of&quot;        
##  [3952] &quot;whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing,&quot;     
##  [3953] &quot;or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her&quot;               
##  [3954] &quot;appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.&quot;           
##  [3955] &quot;Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond&quot;      
##  [3956] &quot;mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most&quot;             
##  [3957] &quot;rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands&quot;      
##  [3958] &quot;are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive&quot;           
##  [3959] &quot;affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were&quot;      
##  [3960] &quot;viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or&quot;         
##  [3961] &quot;distrust.  She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent&quot;            
##  [3962] &quot;encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.&quot;        
##  [3963] &quot;She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their&quot;      
##  [3964] &quot;work-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt&quot;     
##  [3965] &quot;no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment.  It suggested no other&quot;        
##  [3966] &quot;surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,&quot;         
##  [3967] &quot;without claiming a share in what was passing.&quot;                               
##  [3968] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3969] &quot;\&quot;John is in such spirits today!\&quot; said she, on his taking Miss Steeles&#39;s&quot;   
##  [3970] &quot;pocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window--\&quot;He is full of&quot;         
##  [3971] &quot;monkey tricks.\&quot;&quot;                                                            
##  [3972] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3973] &quot;And soon afterwards, on the second boy&#39;s violently pinching one of the&quot;      
##  [3974] &quot;same lady&#39;s fingers, she fondly observed, \&quot;How playful William is!\&quot;&quot;       
##  [3975] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3976] &quot;\&quot;And here is my sweet little Annamaria,\&quot; she added, tenderly caressing&quot;    
##  [3977] &quot;a little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the last&quot;     
##  [3978] &quot;two minutes; \&quot;And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was there&quot;       
##  [3979] &quot;such a quiet little thing!\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [3980] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [3981] &quot;But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship&#39;s&quot;      
##  [3982] &quot;head dress slightly scratching the child&#39;s neck, produced from this&quot;         
##  [3983] &quot;pattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone&quot;      
##  [3984] &quot;by any creature professedly noisy.  The mother&#39;s consternation was&quot;          
##  [3985] &quot;excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and&quot;      
##  [3986] &quot;every thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which&quot;       
##  [3987] &quot;affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little&quot;      
##  [3988] &quot;sufferer.  She was seated in her mother&#39;s lap, covered with kisses, her&quot;     
##  [3989] &quot;wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was&quot;       
##  [3990] &quot;on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by&quot;       
##  [3991] &quot;the other.  With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise to&quot;     
##  [3992] &quot;cease crying.  She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two&quot;        
##  [3993] &quot;brothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings were&quot;     
##  [3994] &quot;ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of&quot;      
##  [3995] &quot;similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been&quot;                 
##  [3996] &quot;successfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly&quot;      
##  [3997] &quot;proposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of&quot;         
##  [3998] &quot;screams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that&quot;      
##  [3999] &quot;it would not be rejected.-- She was carried out of the room therefore&quot;       
##  [4000] &quot;in her mother&#39;s arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys&quot;        
##  [4001] &quot;chose to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay&quot;         
##  [4002] &quot;behind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room&quot;       
##  [4003] &quot;had not known for many hours.&quot;                                               
##  [4004] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4005] &quot;\&quot;Poor little creatures!\&quot; said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone.&quot;     
##  [4006] &quot;\&quot;It might have been a very sad accident.\&quot;&quot;                                 
##  [4007] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4008] &quot;\&quot;Yet I hardly know how,\&quot; cried Marianne, \&quot;unless it had been under&quot;       
##  [4009] &quot;totally different circumstances.  But this is the usual way of&quot;              
##  [4010] &quot;heightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality.\&quot;&quot;    
##  [4011] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4012] &quot;\&quot;What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!\&quot; said Lucy Steele.&quot;                 
##  [4013] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4014] &quot;Marianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say what she did not&quot;      
##  [4015] &quot;feel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the whole&quot;     
##  [4016] &quot;task of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell.  She did&quot;     
##  [4017] &quot;her best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton with more&quot;       
##  [4018] &quot;warmth than she felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy.&quot;                  
##  [4019] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4020] &quot;\&quot;And Sir John too,\&quot; cried the elder sister, \&quot;what a charming man he is!\&quot;&quot;
##  [4021] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4022] &quot;Here too, Miss Dashwood&#39;s commendation, being only simple and just,&quot;         
##  [4023] &quot;came in without any eclat.  She merely observed that he was perfectly&quot;       
##  [4024] &quot;good humoured and friendly.&quot;                                                 
##  [4025] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4026] &quot;\&quot;And what a charming little family they have!  I never saw such fine&quot;       
##  [4027] &quot;children in my life.--I declare I quite doat upon them already, and&quot;         
##  [4028] &quot;indeed I am always distractedly fond of children.\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [4029] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4030] &quot;\&quot;I should guess so,\&quot; said Elinor, with a smile, \&quot;from what I have&quot;        
##  [4031] &quot;witnessed this morning.\&quot;&quot;                                                   
##  [4032] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4033] &quot;\&quot;I have a notion,\&quot; said Lucy, \&quot;you think the little Middletons rather&quot;    
##  [4034] &quot;too much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it is&quot;     
##  [4035] &quot;so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see children&quot;       
##  [4036] &quot;full of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and&quot;           
##  [4037] &quot;quiet.\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
##  [4038] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4039] &quot;\&quot;I confess,\&quot; replied Elinor, \&quot;that while I am at Barton Park, I never&quot;    
##  [4040] &quot;think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence.\&quot;&quot;                     
##  [4041] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4042] &quot;A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss&quot;         
##  [4043] &quot;Steele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now&quot;         
##  [4044] &quot;said rather abruptly, \&quot;And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?&quot;      
##  [4045] &quot;I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex.\&quot;&quot;                            
##  [4046] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4047] &quot;In some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least of&quot;        
##  [4048] &quot;the manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she was.&quot;             
##  [4049] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4050] &quot;\&quot;Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?\&quot; added Miss Steele.&quot;  
##  [4051] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4052] &quot;\&quot;We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,\&quot; said Lucy, who seemed&quot;     
##  [4053] &quot;to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister.&quot;              
##  [4054] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4055] &quot;\&quot;I think every one MUST admire it,\&quot; replied Elinor, \&quot;who ever saw the&quot;    
##  [4056] &quot;place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its&quot;        
##  [4057] &quot;beauties as we do.\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##  [4058] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4059] &quot;\&quot;And had you a great many smart beaux there?  I suppose you have not so&quot;    
##  [4060] &quot;many in this part of the world; for my part, I think they are a vast&quot;        
##  [4061] &quot;addition always.\&quot;&quot;                                                          
##  [4062] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4063] &quot;\&quot;But why should you think,\&quot; said Lucy, looking ashamed of her sister,&quot;     
##  [4064] &quot;\&quot;that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex?\&quot;&quot;   
##  [4065] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4066] &quot;\&quot;Nay, my dear, I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t pretend to say that there an&#39;t.  I&#39;m&quot;       
##  [4067] &quot;sure there&#39;s a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how could&quot;     
##  [4068] &quot;I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was only&quot;        
##  [4069] &quot;afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not&quot;     
##  [4070] &quot;so many as they used to have.  But perhaps you young ladies may not&quot;         
##  [4071] &quot;care about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with them.&quot;         
##  [4072] &quot;For my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they dress&quot;         
##  [4073] &quot;smart and behave civil.  But I can&#39;t bear to see them dirty and nasty.&quot;      
##  [4074] &quot;Now there&#39;s Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man, quite a&quot;       
##  [4075] &quot;beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but meet him of&quot;     
##  [4076] &quot;a morning, he is not fit to be seen.-- I suppose your brother was quite&quot;     
##  [4077] &quot;a beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was so rich?\&quot;&quot;              
##  [4078] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4079] &quot;\&quot;Upon my word,\&quot; replied Elinor, \&quot;I cannot tell you, for I do not&quot;         
##  [4080] &quot;perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.  But this I can say, that&quot;     
##  [4081] &quot;if he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is&quot;       
##  [4082] &quot;not the smallest alteration in him.\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [4083] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4084] &quot;\&quot;Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men&#39;s being beaux--they have&quot;        
##  [4085] &quot;something else to do.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##  [4086] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4087] &quot;\&quot;Lord! Anne,\&quot; cried her sister, \&quot;you can talk of nothing but&quot;             
##  [4088] &quot;beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else.\&quot;&quot;    
##  [4089] &quot;And then to turn the discourse, she began admiring the house and the&quot;        
##  [4090] &quot;furniture.&quot;                                                                  
##  [4091] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4092] &quot;This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough.  The vulgar freedom and&quot;       
##  [4093] &quot;folly of the eldest left her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not&quot;       
##  [4094] &quot;blinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her want&quot;      
##  [4095] &quot;of real elegance and artlessness, she left the house without any wish&quot;       
##  [4096] &quot;of knowing them better.&quot;                                                     
##  [4097] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4098] &quot;Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter, well provided with&quot;         
##  [4099] &quot;admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his family, and all his&quot;       
##  [4100] &quot;relations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair&quot;        
##  [4101] &quot;cousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant,&quot;              
##  [4102] &quot;accomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom&quot;       
##  [4103] &quot;they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.-- And to be&quot;         
##  [4104] &quot;better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitable&quot;         
##  [4105] &quot;lot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles,&quot;          
##  [4106] &quot;their party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind of&quot;            
##  [4107] &quot;intimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or two&quot;     
##  [4108] &quot;together in the same room almost every day.  Sir John could do no more;&quot;     
##  [4109] &quot;but he did not know that any more was required: to be together was, in&quot;      
##  [4110] &quot;his opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their&quot;      
##  [4111] &quot;meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being established&quot;       
##  [4112] &quot;friends.&quot;                                                                    
##  [4113] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4114] &quot;To do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote their&quot;         
##  [4115] &quot;unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew&quot;      
##  [4116] &quot;or supposed of his cousins&#39; situations in the most delicate&quot;                 
##  [4117] &quot;particulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the&quot;      
##  [4118] &quot;eldest of them wished her joy on her sister&#39;s having been so lucky as&quot;       
##  [4119] &quot;to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton.&quot;           
##  [4120] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4121] &quot;\&quot;&#39;Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure,\&quot; said&quot;    
##  [4122] &quot;she, \&quot;and I hear he is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome.  And I&quot;       
##  [4123] &quot;hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have&quot;     
##  [4124] &quot;a friend in the corner already.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [4125] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4126] &quot;Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in&quot;                
##  [4127] &quot;proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he had been&quot;       
##  [4128] &quot;with respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of&quot;        
##  [4129] &quot;the two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and since&quot;            
##  [4130] &quot;Edward&#39;s visit, they had never dined together without his drinking to&quot;       
##  [4131] &quot;her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and&quot;          
##  [4132] &quot;winks, as to excite general attention.  The letter F--had been likewise&quot;     
##  [4133] &quot;invariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless&quot;          
##  [4134] &quot;jokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had&quot;        
##  [4135] &quot;been long established with Elinor.&quot;                                          
##  [4136] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4137] &quot;The Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit of these&quot;         
##  [4138] &quot;jokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the&quot;        
##  [4139] &quot;name of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinently&quot;         
##  [4140] &quot;expressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness&quot;        
##  [4141] &quot;into the concerns of their family.  But Sir John did not sport long&quot;         
##  [4142] &quot;with the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least as&quot;      
##  [4143] &quot;much pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it.&quot;        
##  [4144] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4145] &quot;\&quot;His name is Ferrars,\&quot; said he, in a very audible whisper; \&quot;but pray do&quot;  
##  [4146] &quot;not tell it, for it&#39;s a great secret.\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [4147] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4148] &quot;\&quot;Ferrars!\&quot; repeated Miss Steele; \&quot;Mr. Ferrars is the happy man, is he?&quot;   
##  [4149] &quot;What! your sister-in-law&#39;s brother, Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable&quot;         
##  [4150] &quot;young man to be sure; I know him very well.\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [4151] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4152] &quot;\&quot;How can you say so, Anne?\&quot; cried Lucy, who generally made an amendment&quot;   
##  [4153] &quot;to all her sister&#39;s assertions.  \&quot;Though we have seen him once or twice&quot;    
##  [4154] &quot;at my uncle&#39;s, it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well.\&quot;&quot;    
##  [4155] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4156] &quot;Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise.  \&quot;And who was this&quot;      
##  [4157] &quot;uncle?  Where did he live?  How came they acquainted?\&quot;  She wished very&quot;    
##  [4158] &quot;much to have the subject continued, though she did not chuse to join in&quot;     
##  [4159] &quot;it herself; but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time in&quot;      
##  [4160] &quot;her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity after&quot;     
##  [4161] &quot;petty information, or in a disposition to communicate it.  The manner&quot;       
##  [4162] &quot;in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; for&quot;     
##  [4163] &quot;it struck her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion&quot;      
##  [4164] &quot;of that lady&#39;s knowing, or fancying herself to know something to his&quot;        
##  [4165] &quot;disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing, for no farther notice&quot;      
##  [4166] &quot;was taken of Mr. Ferrars&#39;s name by Miss Steele when alluded to, or even&quot;     
##  [4167] &quot;openly mentioned by Sir John.&quot;                                               
##  [4168] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4169] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4170] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4171] &quot;CHAPTER 22&quot;                                                                  
##  [4172] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4173] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4174] &quot;Marianne, who had never much toleration for any thing like&quot;                  
##  [4175] &quot;impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of&quot;        
##  [4176] &quot;taste from herself, was at this time particularly ill-disposed, from&quot;        
##  [4177] &quot;the state of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, or to&quot;        
##  [4178] &quot;encourage their advances; and to the invariable coldness of her&quot;             
##  [4179] &quot;behaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy on&quot;        
##  [4180] &quot;their side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself&quot;        
##  [4181] &quot;which soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially of&quot;         
##  [4182] &quot;Lucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation, or of&quot;      
##  [4183] &quot;striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank&quot;                 
##  [4184] &quot;communication of her sentiments.&quot;                                            
##  [4185] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4186] &quot;Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often just and amusing; and&quot;     
##  [4187] &quot;as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable;&quot;      
##  [4188] &quot;but her powers had received no aid from education: she was ignorant and&quot;     
##  [4189] &quot;illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement, her want of&quot;       
##  [4190] &quot;information in the most common particulars, could not be concealed from&quot;     
##  [4191] &quot;Miss Dashwood, in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to&quot;              
##  [4192] &quot;advantage.  Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities&quot;        
##  [4193] &quot;which education might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with&quot;       
##  [4194] &quot;less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, of&quot;               
##  [4195] &quot;rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, her&quot;                 
##  [4196] &quot;assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have no&quot;     
##  [4197] &quot;lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity&quot;      
##  [4198] &quot;with ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in&quot;        
##  [4199] &quot;conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward others made&quot;     
##  [4200] &quot;every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly&quot;             
##  [4201] &quot;valueless.&quot;                                                                  
##  [4202] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4203] &quot;\&quot;You will think my question an odd one, I dare say,\&quot; said Lucy to her&quot;     
##  [4204] &quot;one day, as they were walking together from the park to the&quot;                 
##  [4205] &quot;cottage--\&quot;but pray, are you personally acquainted with your&quot;                
##  [4206] &quot;sister-in-law&#39;s mother, Mrs. Ferrars?\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [4207] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4208] &quot;Elinor DID think the question a very odd one, and her countenance&quot;           
##  [4209] &quot;expressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.&quot;         
##  [4210] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4211] &quot;\&quot;Indeed!\&quot; replied Lucy; \&quot;I wonder at that, for I thought you must have&quot;   
##  [4212] &quot;seen her at Norland sometimes.  Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what&quot;      
##  [4213] &quot;sort of a woman she is?\&quot;&quot;                                                   
##  [4214] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4215] &quot;\&quot;No,\&quot; returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward&#39;s&quot;    
##  [4216] &quot;mother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent&quot;         
##  [4217] &quot;curiosity-- \&quot;I know nothing of her.\&quot;&quot;                                      
##  [4218] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4219] &quot;\&quot;I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such a&quot;    
##  [4220] &quot;way,\&quot; said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke; \&quot;but perhaps&quot;     
##  [4221] &quot;there may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I hope you&quot;        
##  [4222] &quot;will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be&quot;                
##  [4223] &quot;impertinent.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [4224] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4225] &quot;Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in&quot;      
##  [4226] &quot;silence.  It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again by&quot;           
##  [4227] &quot;saying, with some hesitation,&quot;                                               
##  [4228] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4229] &quot;\&quot;I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious.  I am sure I&quot;    
##  [4230] &quot;would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person&quot;       
##  [4231] &quot;whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours.  And I am sure I&quot;       
##  [4232] &quot;should not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should be&quot;      
##  [4233] &quot;very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable&quot;             
##  [4234] &quot;situation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU.&quot;       
##  [4235] &quot;I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.\&quot;&quot;                        
##  [4236] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4237] &quot;\&quot;I am sorry I do NOT,\&quot; said Elinor, in great astonishment, \&quot;if it could&quot;  
##  [4238] &quot;be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her.  But really I never&quot;         
##  [4239] &quot;understood that you were at all connected with that family, and&quot;             
##  [4240] &quot;therefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry&quot;      
##  [4241] &quot;into her character.\&quot;&quot;                                                       
##  [4242] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4243] &quot;\&quot;I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it.  But&quot;      
##  [4244] &quot;if I dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised.  Mrs.&quot;          
##  [4245] &quot;Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present--but the time MAY&quot;             
##  [4246] &quot;come--how soon it will come must depend upon herself--when we may be&quot;        
##  [4247] &quot;very intimately connected.\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [4248] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4249] &quot;She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful, with only one side&quot;       
##  [4250] &quot;glance at her companion to observe its effect on her.&quot;                       
##  [4251] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4252] &quot;\&quot;Good heavens!\&quot; cried Elinor, \&quot;what do you mean?  Are you acquainted&quot;     
##  [4253] &quot;with Mr. Robert Ferrars?  Can you be?\&quot; And she did not feel much&quot;           
##  [4254] &quot;delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law.&quot;                            
##  [4255] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4256] &quot;\&quot;No,\&quot; replied Lucy, \&quot;not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I never saw him in my&quot;    
##  [4257] &quot;life; but,\&quot; fixing her eyes upon Elinor, \&quot;to his eldest brother.\&quot;&quot;        
##  [4258] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4259] &quot;What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been as&quot;      
##  [4260] &quot;painful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the&quot;             
##  [4261] &quot;assertion attended it.  She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,&quot;        
##  [4262] &quot;unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and though&quot;     
##  [4263] &quot;her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt in no&quot;        
##  [4264] &quot;danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.&quot;                                    
##  [4265] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4266] &quot;\&quot;You may well be surprised,\&quot; continued Lucy; \&quot;for to be sure you could&quot;   
##  [4267] &quot;have had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped the&quot;          
##  [4268] &quot;smallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was always&quot;     
##  [4269] &quot;meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully kept so&quot;       
##  [4270] &quot;by me to this hour.  Not a soul of all my relations know of it but&quot;          
##  [4271] &quot;Anne, and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not felt&quot;        
##  [4272] &quot;the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I really&quot;        
##  [4273] &quot;thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars&quot;         
##  [4274] &quot;must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.  And I do not think&quot;        
##  [4275] &quot;Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted you,&quot;            
##  [4276] &quot;because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your&quot;          
##  [4277] &quot;family, and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as&quot;       
##  [4278] &quot;his own sisters.\&quot;--She paused.&quot;                                             
##  [4279] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4280] &quot;Elinor for a few moments remained silent.  Her astonishment at what she&quot;     
##  [4281] &quot;heard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself&quot;       
##  [4282] &quot;to speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,&quot;       
##  [4283] &quot;which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude-- \&quot;May I ask&quot;    
##  [4284] &quot;if your engagement is of long standing?\&quot;&quot;                                   
##  [4285] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4286] &quot;\&quot;We have been engaged these four years.\&quot;&quot;                                  
##  [4287] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4288] &quot;\&quot;Four years!\&quot;&quot;                                                             
##  [4289] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4290] &quot;\&quot;Yes.\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
##  [4291] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4292] &quot;Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it.&quot;            
##  [4293] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4294] &quot;\&quot;I did not know,\&quot; said she, \&quot;that you were even acquainted till the&quot;      
##  [4295] &quot;other day.\&quot;&quot;                                                                
##  [4296] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4297] &quot;\&quot;Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date.  He was under my&quot;        
##  [4298] &quot;uncle&#39;s care, you know, a considerable while.\&quot;&quot;                             
##  [4299] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4300] &quot;\&quot;Your uncle!\&quot;&quot;                                                             
##  [4301] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4302] &quot;\&quot;Yes; Mr. Pratt.  Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?\&quot;&quot;              
##  [4303] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4304] &quot;\&quot;I think I have,\&quot; replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which&quot;      
##  [4305] &quot;increased with her increase of emotion.&quot;                                     
##  [4306] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4307] &quot;\&quot;He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near&quot;            
##  [4308] &quot;Plymouth.  It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me&quot;        
##  [4309] &quot;was often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was&quot;        
##  [4310] &quot;formed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he&quot;      
##  [4311] &quot;was almost always with us afterwards.  I was very unwilling to enter&quot;        
##  [4312] &quot;into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of&quot;       
##  [4313] &quot;his mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so&quot;           
##  [4314] &quot;prudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him so well&quot;       
##  [4315] &quot;as me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible&quot;       
##  [4316] &quot;he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.\&quot;&quot;           
##  [4317] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4318] &quot;\&quot;Certainly,\&quot; answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but after&quot;    
##  [4319] &quot;a moment&#39;s reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward&#39;s&quot;         
##  [4320] &quot;honour and love, and her companion&#39;s falsehood--\&quot;Engaged to Mr. Edward&quot;     
##  [4321] &quot;Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,&quot;        
##  [4322] &quot;that really--I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake&quot;       
##  [4323] &quot;of person or name.  We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.\&quot;&quot;                  
##  [4324] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4325] &quot;\&quot;We can mean no other,\&quot; cried Lucy, smiling.  \&quot;Mr. Edward Ferrars, the&quot;   
##  [4326] &quot;eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your&quot;             
##  [4327] &quot;sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must allow&quot;     
##  [4328] &quot;that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who&quot;        
##  [4329] &quot;all my happiness depends.\&quot;&quot;                                                 
##  [4330] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4331] &quot;\&quot;It is strange,\&quot; replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, \&quot;that I&quot;   
##  [4332] &quot;should never have heard him even mention your name.\&quot;&quot;                       
##  [4333] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4334] &quot;\&quot;No; considering our situation, it was not strange.  Our first care has&quot;    
##  [4335] &quot;been to keep the matter secret.-- You knew nothing of me, or my family,&quot;     
##  [4336] &quot;and, therefore, there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name&quot;      
##  [4337] &quot;to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister&#39;s&quot;           
##  [4338] &quot;suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it.\&quot;&quot;   
##  [4339] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4340] &quot;She was silent.--Elinor&#39;s security sunk; but her self-command did not&quot;       
##  [4341] &quot;sink with it.&quot;                                                               
##  [4342] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4343] &quot;\&quot;Four years you have been engaged,\&quot; said she with a firm voice.&quot;           
##  [4344] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4345] &quot;\&quot;Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait.  Poor&quot;          
##  [4346] &quot;Edward!  It puts him quite out of heart.\&quot; Then taking a small miniature&quot;    
##  [4347] &quot;from her pocket, she added, \&quot;To prevent the possibility of mistake, be&quot;     
##  [4348] &quot;so good as to look at this face.  It does not do him justice, to be&quot;         
##  [4349] &quot;sure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was&quot;        
##  [4350] &quot;drew for.--I have had it above these three years.\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [4351] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4352] &quot;She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor saw the&quot;             
##  [4353] &quot;painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, or&quot;        
##  [4354] &quot;her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind, she&quot;     
##  [4355] &quot;could have none of its being Edward&#39;s face.  She returned it almost&quot;         
##  [4356] &quot;instantly, acknowledging the likeness.&quot;                                      
##  [4357] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4358] &quot;\&quot;I have never been able,\&quot; continued Lucy, \&quot;to give him my picture in&quot;     
##  [4359] &quot;return, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so&quot;            
##  [4360] &quot;anxious to get it!  But I am determined to set for it the very first&quot;        
##  [4361] &quot;opportunity.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [4362] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4363] &quot;\&quot;You are quite in the right,\&quot; replied Elinor calmly.  They then&quot;           
##  [4364] &quot;proceeded a few paces in silence.  Lucy spoke first.&quot;                        
##  [4365] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4366] &quot;\&quot;I am sure,\&quot; said she, \&quot;I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully&quot;  
##  [4367] &quot;keeping this secret, because you must know of what importance it is to&quot;      
##  [4368] &quot;us, not to have it reach his mother; for she would never approve of it,&quot;     
##  [4369] &quot;I dare say.  I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding&quot;       
##  [4370] &quot;proud woman.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [4371] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4372] &quot;\&quot;I certainly did not seek your confidence,\&quot; said Elinor; \&quot;but you do me&quot;  
##  [4373] &quot;no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on.  Your&quot;          
##  [4374] &quot;secret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so&quot;      
##  [4375] &quot;unnecessary a communication.  You must at least have felt that my being&quot;     
##  [4376] &quot;acquainted with it could not add to its safety.\&quot;&quot;                           
##  [4377] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4378] &quot;As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover&quot;          
##  [4379] &quot;something in her countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest&quot;         
##  [4380] &quot;part of what she had been saying; but Lucy&#39;s countenance suffered no&quot;        
##  [4381] &quot;change.&quot;                                                                     
##  [4382] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4383] &quot;\&quot;I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,\&quot;&quot;     
##  [4384] &quot;said she, \&quot;in telling you all this.  I have not known you long to be&quot;       
##  [4385] &quot;sure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by&quot;      
##  [4386] &quot;description a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as&quot;       
##  [4387] &quot;if you was an old acquaintance.  Besides in the present case, I really&quot;      
##  [4388] &quot;thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular&quot;     
##  [4389] &quot;inquiries about Edward&#39;s mother; and I am so unfortunate, that I have&quot;       
##  [4390] &quot;not a creature whose advice I can ask.  Anne is the only person that&quot;        
##  [4391] &quot;knows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a&quot;          
##  [4392] &quot;great deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her&quot;            
##  [4393] &quot;betraying me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you must&quot;        
##  [4394] &quot;perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world&quot;           
##  [4395] &quot;t&#39;other day, when Edward&#39;s name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she&quot;         
##  [4396] &quot;should out with it all.  You can&#39;t think how much I go through in my&quot;        
##  [4397] &quot;mind from it altogether.  I only wonder that I am alive after what I&quot;        
##  [4398] &quot;have suffered for Edward&#39;s sake these last four years.  Every thing in&quot;      
##  [4399] &quot;such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom--we can hardly&quot;      
##  [4400] &quot;meet above twice a-year.  I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite&quot;          
##  [4401] &quot;broke.\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
##  [4402] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4403] &quot;Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very&quot;            
##  [4404] &quot;compassionate.&quot;                                                              
##  [4405] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4406] &quot;\&quot;Sometimes.\&quot; continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, \&quot;I think whether it&quot;  
##  [4407] &quot;would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely.\&quot;  As&quot;     
##  [4408] &quot;she said this, she looked directly at her companion.  \&quot;But then at&quot;         
##  [4409] &quot;other times I have not resolution enough for it.-- I cannot bear the&quot;        
##  [4410] &quot;thoughts of making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of such&quot;     
##  [4411] &quot;a thing would do.  And on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--I&quot;     
##  [4412] &quot;don&#39;t think I could be equal to it.  What would you advise me to do in&quot;      
##  [4413] &quot;such a case, Miss Dashwood?  What would you do yourself?\&quot;&quot;                  
##  [4414] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4415] &quot;\&quot;Pardon me,\&quot; replied Elinor, startled by the question; \&quot;but I can give&quot;   
##  [4416] &quot;you no advice under such circumstances.  Your own judgment must direct&quot;      
##  [4417] &quot;you.\&quot;&quot;                                                                      
##  [4418] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4419] &quot;\&quot;To be sure,\&quot; continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both&quot;         
##  [4420] &quot;sides, \&quot;his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poor&quot;        
##  [4421] &quot;Edward is so cast down by it!  Did you not think him dreadful&quot;               
##  [4422] &quot;low-spirited when he was at Barton?  He was so miserable when he left&quot;       
##  [4423] &quot;us at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him&quot;       
##  [4424] &quot;quite ill.\&quot;&quot;                                                                
##  [4425] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4426] &quot;\&quot;Did he come from your uncle&#39;s, then, when he visited us?\&quot;&quot;                
##  [4427] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4428] &quot;\&quot;Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us.  Did you think he&quot;       
##  [4429] &quot;came directly from town?\&quot;&quot;                                                  
##  [4430] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4431] &quot;\&quot;No,\&quot; replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh&quot;              
##  [4432] &quot;circumstance in favour of Lucy&#39;s veracity; \&quot;I remember he told us, that&quot;    
##  [4433] &quot;he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.\&quot; She&quot;      
##  [4434] &quot;remembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning nothing&quot;     
##  [4435] &quot;farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect even to&quot;         
##  [4436] &quot;their names.&quot;                                                                
##  [4437] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4438] &quot;\&quot;Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?\&quot; repeated Lucy.&quot;              
##  [4439] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4440] &quot;\&quot;We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.\&quot;&quot;                  
##  [4441] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4442] &quot;\&quot;I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the&quot;    
##  [4443] &quot;matter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more than&quot;     
##  [4444] &quot;a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--I&quot;      
##  [4445] &quot;am afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes in wretched&quot;       
##  [4446] &quot;spirits.  I heard from him just before I left Exeter;\&quot; taking a letter&quot;     
##  [4447] &quot;from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.  \&quot;You&quot;      
##  [4448] &quot;know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is; but that is not&quot;            
##  [4449] &quot;written so well as usual.--He was tired, I dare say, for he had just&quot;        
##  [4450] &quot;filled the sheet to me as full as possible.\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [4451] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4452] &quot;Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt no longer.  This&quot;       
##  [4453] &quot;picture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been&quot;                
##  [4454] &quot;accidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward&#39;s gift; but a&quot;          
##  [4455] &quot;correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a&quot;           
##  [4456] &quot;positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few&quot;         
##  [4457] &quot;moments, she was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she&quot;        
##  [4458] &quot;could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she&quot;       
##  [4459] &quot;struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that&quot;        
##  [4460] &quot;her success was speedy, and for the time complete.&quot;                          
##  [4461] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4462] &quot;\&quot;Writing to each other,\&quot; said Lucy, returning the letter into her&quot;         
##  [4463] &quot;pocket, \&quot;is the only comfort we have in such long separations.  Yes, I&quot;     
##  [4464] &quot;have one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not even&quot;         
##  [4465] &quot;THAT.  If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.  I gave him&quot;     
##  [4466] &quot;a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last, and&quot;         
##  [4467] &quot;that was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture.&quot;          
##  [4468] &quot;Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?\&quot;&quot;                       
##  [4469] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4470] &quot;\&quot;I did,\&quot; said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which was&quot;          
##  [4471] &quot;concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt&quot;        
##  [4472] &quot;before.  She was mortified, shocked, confounded.&quot;                            
##  [4473] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4474] &quot;Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and the&quot;              
##  [4475] &quot;conversation could be continued no farther.  After sitting with them a&quot;      
##  [4476] &quot;few minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was then&quot;     
##  [4477] &quot;at liberty to think and be wretched.&quot;                                        
##  [4478] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4479] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4480] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4481] &quot;&quot;

##  [4492] &quot;However small Elinor&#39;s general dependence on Lucy&#39;s veracity might be,&quot;      
##  [4493] &quot;it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the&quot;        
##  [4494] &quot;present case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of&quot;       
##  [4495] &quot;inventing a falsehood of such a description.  What Lucy had asserted to&quot;     
##  [4496] &quot;be true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt; supported&quot;     
##  [4497] &quot;as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, and&quot;           
##  [4498] &quot;contradicted by nothing but her own wishes.  Their opportunity of&quot;           
##  [4499] &quot;acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest,&quot;       
##  [4500] &quot;at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward&#39;s visit near Plymouth,&quot;        
##  [4501] &quot;his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own prospects,&quot;     
##  [4502] &quot;his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the&quot;      
##  [4503] &quot;Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which had&quot;          
##  [4504] &quot;often surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formed&quot;              
##  [4505] &quot;altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear of&quot;               
##  [4506] &quot;condemning him unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partiality&quot;     
##  [4507] &quot;could set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.--Her resentment of such&quot;      
##  [4508] &quot;behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time&quot;        
##  [4509] &quot;made her feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations,&quot;      
##  [4510] &quot;soon arose.  Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?  Had he&quot;           
##  [4511] &quot;feigned a regard for her which he did not feel?  Was his engagement to&quot;      
##  [4512] &quot;Lucy an engagement of the heart?  No; whatever it might once have been,&quot;     
##  [4513] &quot;she could not believe it such at present.  His affection was all her&quot;        
##  [4514] &quot;own.  She could not be deceived in that.  Her mother, sisters, Fanny,&quot;       
##  [4515] &quot;all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not an&quot;      
##  [4516] &quot;illusion of her own vanity.  He certainly loved her.  What a softener&quot;       
##  [4517] &quot;of the heart was this persuasion!  How much could it not tempt her to&quot;       
##  [4518] &quot;forgive!  He had been blamable, highly blamable, in remaining at&quot;            
##  [4519] &quot;Norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it&quot;       
##  [4520] &quot;ought to be.  In that, he could not be defended; but if he had injured&quot;      
##  [4521] &quot;her, how much more had he injured himself; if her case were pitiable,&quot;       
##  [4522] &quot;his was hopeless.  His imprudence had made her miserable for a while;&quot;       
##  [4523] &quot;but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being&quot;          
##  [4524] &quot;otherwise.  She might in time regain tranquillity; but HE, what had he&quot;      
##  [4525] &quot;to look forward to?  Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele;&quot;     
##  [4526] &quot;could he, were his affection for herself out of the question, with his&quot;      
##  [4527] &quot;integrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a&quot;        
##  [4528] &quot;wife like her--illiterate, artful, and selfish?&quot;                             
##  [4529] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4530] &quot;The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every&quot;     
##  [4531] &quot;thing but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding&quot;               
##  [4532] &quot;years--years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the&quot;       
##  [4533] &quot;understanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education,&quot;       
##  [4534] &quot;while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society&quot;        
##  [4535] &quot;and more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity&quot;      
##  [4536] &quot;which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty.&quot;         
##  [4537] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4538] &quot;If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his difficulties&quot;     
##  [4539] &quot;from his mother had seemed great, how much greater were they now likely&quot;     
##  [4540] &quot;to be, when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in&quot;        
##  [4541] &quot;connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.  These&quot;            
##  [4542] &quot;difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Lucy, might not&quot;        
##  [4543] &quot;press very hard upon his patience; but melancholy was the state of the&quot;      
##  [4544] &quot;person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness,&quot;         
##  [4545] &quot;could be felt as a relief!&quot;                                                  
##  [4546] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4547] &quot;As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she wept&quot;     
##  [4548] &quot;for him, more than for herself.  Supported by the conviction of having&quot;      
##  [4549] &quot;done nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the&quot;          
##  [4550] &quot;belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she thought&quot;      
##  [4551] &quot;she could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, command&quot;        
##  [4552] &quot;herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother&quot;        
##  [4553] &quot;and sisters.  And so well was she able to answer her own expectations,&quot;      
##  [4554] &quot;that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first&quot;      
##  [4555] &quot;suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one would have&quot;         
##  [4556] &quot;supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning&quot;       
##  [4557] &quot;in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object&quot;     
##  [4558] &quot;of her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the&quot;               
##  [4559] &quot;perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly&quot;              
##  [4560] &quot;possessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove&quot;       
##  [4561] &quot;near their house.&quot;                                                           
##  [4562] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4563] &quot;The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had been&quot;     
##  [4564] &quot;entrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to unceasing&quot;      
##  [4565] &quot;exertion, was no aggravation of Elinor&#39;s distress.  On the contrary it&quot;      
##  [4566] &quot;was a relief to her, to be spared the communication of what would give&quot;      
##  [4567] &quot;such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing that&quot;         
##  [4568] &quot;condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess of&quot;        
##  [4569] &quot;their partial affection for herself, and which was more than she felt&quot;       
##  [4570] &quot;equal to support.&quot;                                                           
##  [4571] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4572] &quot;From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receive&quot;       
##  [4573] &quot;no assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress,&quot;        
##  [4574] &quot;while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their&quot;       
##  [4575] &quot;example nor from their praise.  She was stronger alone, and her own&quot;         
##  [4576] &quot;good sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken,&quot;        
##  [4577] &quot;her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so&quot;            
##  [4578] &quot;poignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.&quot;                      
##  [4579] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4580] &quot;Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the&quot;       
##  [4581] &quot;subject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for&quot;         
##  [4582] &quot;more reasons than one.  She wanted to hear many particulars of their&quot;        
##  [4583] &quot;engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what&quot;       
##  [4584] &quot;Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her&quot;        
##  [4585] &quot;declaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to&quot;        
##  [4586] &quot;convince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her&quot;       
##  [4587] &quot;calmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in&quot;       
##  [4588] &quot;it than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary&quot;             
##  [4589] &quot;agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least&quot;              
##  [4590] &quot;doubtful.  That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very&quot;        
##  [4591] &quot;probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her&quot;          
##  [4592] &quot;praise, not merely from Lucy&#39;s assertion, but from her venturing to&quot;         
##  [4593] &quot;trust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so&quot;             
##  [4594] &quot;confessedly and evidently important.  And even Sir John&#39;s joking&quot;            
##  [4595] &quot;intelligence must have had some weight.  But indeed, while Elinor&quot;           
##  [4596] &quot;remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by&quot;          
##  [4597] &quot;Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it&quot;      
##  [4598] &quot;natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very&quot;          
##  [4599] &quot;confidence was a proof.  What other reason for the disclosure of the&quot;        
##  [4600] &quot;affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of&quot;           
##  [4601] &quot;Lucy&#39;s superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future?&quot;     
##  [4602] &quot;She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival&#39;s&quot;         
##  [4603] &quot;intentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every&quot;        
##  [4604] &quot;principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own affection&quot;       
##  [4605] &quot;for Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny&quot;         
##  [4606] &quot;herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was&quot;     
##  [4607] &quot;unwounded.  And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on&quot;       
##  [4608] &quot;the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her own&quot;        
##  [4609] &quot;ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure.&quot;        
##  [4610] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4611] &quot;But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be&quot;         
##  [4612] &quot;commanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take&quot;              
##  [4613] &quot;advantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fine&quot;          
##  [4614] &quot;enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most&quot;           
##  [4615] &quot;easily separate themselves from the others; and though they met at&quot;          
##  [4616] &quot;least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly at&quot;     
##  [4617] &quot;the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of&quot;              
##  [4618] &quot;conversation.  Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady&quot;     
##  [4619] &quot;Middleton&#39;s head; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for&quot;      
##  [4620] &quot;a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse.  They met for&quot;     
##  [4621] &quot;the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,&quot;      
##  [4622] &quot;or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.&quot;             
##  [4623] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4624] &quot;One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording&quot;         
##  [4625] &quot;Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at&quot;      
##  [4626] &quot;the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they&quot;          
##  [4627] &quot;would all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged to&quot;           
##  [4628] &quot;attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone,&quot;          
##  [4629] &quot;except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.  Elinor, who foresaw a&quot;          
##  [4630] &quot;fairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this&quot;       
##  [4631] &quot;was likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil&quot;       
##  [4632] &quot;and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united&quot;      
##  [4633] &quot;them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the&quot;                
##  [4634] &quot;invitation; Margaret, with her mother&#39;s permission, was equally&quot;             
##  [4635] &quot;compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their&quot;       
##  [4636] &quot;parties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her&quot;        
##  [4637] &quot;seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.&quot;               
##  [4638] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4639] &quot;The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from&quot;        
##  [4640] &quot;the frightful solitude which had threatened her.  The insipidity of the&quot;     
##  [4641] &quot;meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one&quot;        
##  [4642] &quot;novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interesting&quot;     
##  [4643] &quot;than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and&quot;            
##  [4644] &quot;drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and while&quot;       
##  [4645] &quot;they remained there, she was too well convinced of the impossibility of&quot;     
##  [4646] &quot;engaging Lucy&#39;s attention to attempt it.  They quitted it only with the&quot;     
##  [4647] &quot;removal of the tea-things.  The card-table was then placed, and Elinor&quot;      
##  [4648] &quot;began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of&quot;            
##  [4649] &quot;finding time for conversation at the park.  They all rose up in&quot;             
##  [4650] &quot;preparation for a round game.&quot;                                               
##  [4651] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4652] &quot;\&quot;I am glad,\&quot; said Lady Middleton to Lucy, \&quot;you are not going to finish&quot;   
##  [4653] &quot;poor little Annamaria&#39;s basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt&quot;     
##  [4654] &quot;your eyes to work filigree by candlelight.  And we will make the dear&quot;       
##  [4655] &quot;little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and then I&quot;        
##  [4656] &quot;hope she will not much mind it.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [4657] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4658] &quot;This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied,&quot;       
##  [4659] &quot;\&quot;Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waiting&quot;      
##  [4660] &quot;to know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have&quot;        
##  [4661] &quot;been at my filigree already.  I would not disappoint the little angel&quot;       
##  [4662] &quot;for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I am&quot;           
##  [4663] &quot;resolved to finish the basket after supper.\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [4664] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4665] &quot;\&quot;You are very good, I hope it won&#39;t hurt your eyes--will you ring the&quot;      
##  [4666] &quot;bell for some working candles?  My poor little girl would be sadly&quot;          
##  [4667] &quot;disappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for&quot;          
##  [4668] &quot;though I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon&quot;        
##  [4669] &quot;having it done.\&quot;&quot;                                                           
##  [4670] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4671] &quot;Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an&quot;     
##  [4672] &quot;alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no&quot;     
##  [4673] &quot;greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.&quot;        
##  [4674] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4675] &quot;Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others.  No one made&quot;      
##  [4676] &quot;any objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the forms&quot;     
##  [4677] &quot;of general civility, exclaimed, \&quot;Your Ladyship will have the goodness&quot;      
##  [4678] &quot;to excuse ME--you know I detest cards.  I shall go to the piano-forte;&quot;      
##  [4679] &quot;I have not touched it since it was tuned.\&quot;  And without farther&quot;            
##  [4680] &quot;ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.&quot;                     
##  [4681] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4682] &quot;Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that SHE had never made&quot;      
##  [4683] &quot;so rude a speech.&quot;                                                           
##  [4684] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4685] &quot;\&quot;Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma&#39;am,\&quot;&quot;      
##  [4686] &quot;said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; \&quot;and I do not&quot;        
##  [4687] &quot;much wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever&quot;         
##  [4688] &quot;heard.\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
##  [4689] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4690] &quot;The remaining five were now to draw their cards.&quot;                            
##  [4691] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4692] &quot;\&quot;Perhaps,\&quot; continued Elinor, \&quot;if I should happen to cut out, I may be&quot;    
##  [4693] &quot;of some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; and&quot;         
##  [4694] &quot;there is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be&quot;            
##  [4695] &quot;impossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening.  I&quot;     
##  [4696] &quot;should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in it.\&quot;&quot;    
##  [4697] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4698] &quot;\&quot;Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help,\&quot; cried Lucy,&quot;   
##  [4699] &quot;\&quot;for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was;&quot;       
##  [4700] &quot;and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after&quot;         
##  [4701] &quot;all.\&quot;&quot;                                                                      
##  [4702] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4703] &quot;\&quot;Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,\&quot; said Miss Steele-- \&quot;Dear little&quot;    
##  [4704] &quot;soul, how I do love her!\&quot;&quot;                                                  
##  [4705] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4706] &quot;\&quot;You are very kind,\&quot; said Lady Middleton to Elinor; \&quot;and as you really&quot;   
##  [4707] &quot;like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till&quot;       
##  [4708] &quot;another rubber, or will you take your chance now?\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [4709] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4710] &quot;Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by a&quot;     
##  [4711] &quot;little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to&quot;             
##  [4712] &quot;practise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same&quot;        
##  [4713] &quot;time.  Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fair&quot;        
##  [4714] &quot;rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the&quot;       
##  [4715] &quot;utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.  The pianoforte at&quot;     
##  [4716] &quot;which Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, had&quot;       
##  [4717] &quot;by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,&quot;       
##  [4718] &quot;was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might&quot;            
##  [4719] &quot;safely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting&quot;           
##  [4720] &quot;subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.&quot;                 
##  [4721] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4722] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4723] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4724] &quot;CHAPTER 24&quot;                                                                  
##  [4725] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4726] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4727] &quot;In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.&quot;                         
##  [4728] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4729] &quot;\&quot;I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with,&quot;      
##  [4730] &quot;if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on its&quot;     
##  [4731] &quot;subject.  I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.\&quot;&quot;   
##  [4732] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4733] &quot;\&quot;Thank you,\&quot; cried Lucy warmly, \&quot;for breaking the ice; you have set my&quot;   
##  [4734] &quot;heart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended&quot;       
##  [4735] &quot;you by what I told you that Monday.\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [4736] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4737] &quot;\&quot;Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,\&quot; and Elinor spoke&quot;     
##  [4738] &quot;it with the truest sincerity, \&quot;nothing could be farther from my&quot;            
##  [4739] &quot;intention than to give you such an idea.  Could you have a motive for&quot;       
##  [4740] &quot;the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?\&quot;&quot;                  
##  [4741] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4742] &quot;\&quot;And yet I do assure you,\&quot; replied Lucy, her little sharp eyes full of&quot;    
##  [4743] &quot;meaning, \&quot;there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your&quot;      
##  [4744] &quot;manner that made me quite uncomfortable.  I felt sure that you was&quot;          
##  [4745] &quot;angry with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for&quot;        
##  [4746] &quot;having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs.  But I am&quot;     
##  [4747] &quot;very glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not&quot;      
##  [4748] &quot;blame me.  If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my&quot;        
##  [4749] &quot;heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of&quot;       
##  [4750] &quot;my life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am&quot;      
##  [4751] &quot;sure.\&quot;&quot;                                                                     
##  [4752] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4753] &quot;\&quot;Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you,&quot;      
##  [4754] &quot;to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall&quot;          
##  [4755] &quot;never have reason to repent it.  Your case is a very unfortunate one;&quot;       
##  [4756] &quot;you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have&quot;        
##  [4757] &quot;need of all your mutual affection to support you under them.  Mr.&quot;           
##  [4758] &quot;Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.\&quot;&quot;                  
##  [4759] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4760] &quot;\&quot;He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to&quot;        
##  [4761] &quot;marry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospect&quot;     
##  [4762] &quot;of more without a sigh.  I have been always used to a very small&quot;            
##  [4763] &quot;income, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too&quot;     
##  [4764] &quot;well to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that his&quot;       
##  [4765] &quot;mother might give him if he married to please her.  We must wait, it&quot;        
##  [4766] &quot;may be for many years.  With almost every other man in the world, it&quot;        
##  [4767] &quot;would be an alarming prospect; but Edward&#39;s affection and constancy&quot;         
##  [4768] &quot;nothing can deprive me of I know.\&quot;&quot;                                         
##  [4769] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4770] &quot;\&quot;That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedly&quot;         
##  [4771] &quot;supported by the same trust in your&#39;s.  If the strength of your&quot;             
##  [4772] &quot;reciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and under&quot;         
##  [4773] &quot;many circumstances it naturally would during a four years&#39; engagement,&quot;      
##  [4774] &quot;your situation would have been pitiable, indeed.\&quot;&quot;                          
##  [4775] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4776] &quot;Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her countenance&quot;     
##  [4777] &quot;from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency.&quot;      
##  [4778] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4779] &quot;\&quot;Edward&#39;s love for me,\&quot; said Lucy, \&quot;has been pretty well put to the&quot;      
##  [4780] &quot;test, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, and&quot;       
##  [4781] &quot;it has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt&quot;      
##  [4782] &quot;it now.  I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment&#39;s alarm&quot;      
##  [4783] &quot;on that account from the first.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [4784] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4785] &quot;Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion.&quot;              
##  [4786] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4787] &quot;Lucy went on.  \&quot;I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and from&quot;    
##  [4788] &quot;our different situations in life, from his being so much more in the&quot;        
##  [4789] &quot;world than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined for&quot;      
##  [4790] &quot;suspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been&quot;     
##  [4791] &quot;the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or any&quot;         
##  [4792] &quot;lowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had talked&quot;        
##  [4793] &quot;more of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less happy at&quot;       
##  [4794] &quot;Longstaple than he used to be.  I do not mean to say that I am&quot;              
##  [4795] &quot;particularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case&quot;      
##  [4796] &quot;I am sure I could not be deceived.\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [4797] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4798] &quot;\&quot;All this,\&quot; thought Elinor, \&quot;is very pretty; but it can impose upon&quot;      
##  [4799] &quot;neither of us.\&quot;&quot;                                                            
##  [4800] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4801] &quot;\&quot;But what,\&quot; said she after a short silence, \&quot;are your views? or have&quot;     
##  [4802] &quot;you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s death, which is a&quot;           
##  [4803] &quot;melancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to&quot;      
##  [4804] &quot;this, and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which&quot;     
##  [4805] &quot;it may involve you, rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a&quot;       
##  [4806] &quot;while by owning the truth?\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [4807] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4808] &quot;\&quot;If we could be certain that it would be only for a while!  But Mrs.&quot;       
##  [4809] &quot;Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her first fit of anger&quot;     
##  [4810] &quot;upon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert, and&quot;        
##  [4811] &quot;the idea of that, for Edward&#39;s sake, frightens away all my inclination&quot;      
##  [4812] &quot;for hasty measures.\&quot;&quot;                                                       
##  [4813] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4814] &quot;\&quot;And for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestedness&quot;     
##  [4815] &quot;beyond reason.\&quot;&quot;                                                            
##  [4816] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4817] &quot;Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.&quot;                                
##  [4818] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4819] &quot;\&quot;Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?\&quot; asked Elinor.&quot;                           
##  [4820] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4821] &quot;\&quot;Not at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he is very unlike his&quot;            
##  [4822] &quot;brother--silly and a great coxcomb.\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [4823] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4824] &quot;\&quot;A great coxcomb!\&quot; repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had caught those&quot;       
##  [4825] &quot;words by a sudden pause in Marianne&#39;s music.-- \&quot;Oh, they are talking of&quot;    
##  [4826] &quot;their favourite beaux, I dare say.\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [4827] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4828] &quot;\&quot;No sister,\&quot; cried Lucy, \&quot;you are mistaken there, our favourite beaux&quot;    
##  [4829] &quot;are NOT great coxcombs.\&quot;&quot;                                                   
##  [4830] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4831] &quot;\&quot;I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood&#39;s is not,\&quot; said Mrs. Jennings,&quot;    
##  [4832] &quot;laughing heartily; \&quot;for he is one of the modestest, prettiest behaved&quot;      
##  [4833] &quot;young men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little&quot;             
##  [4834] &quot;creature, there is no finding out who SHE likes.\&quot;&quot;                          
##  [4835] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4836] &quot;\&quot;Oh,\&quot; cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round at them, \&quot;I dare&quot;    
##  [4837] &quot;say Lucy&#39;s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss&quot;               
##  [4838] &quot;Dashwood&#39;s.\&quot;&quot;                                                               
##  [4839] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4840] &quot;Elinor blushed in spite of herself.  Lucy bit her lip, and looked&quot;           
##  [4841] &quot;angrily at her sister.  A mutual silence took place for some time.&quot;          
##  [4842] &quot;Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Marianne&quot;      
##  [4843] &quot;was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent&quot;          
##  [4844] &quot;concerto--&quot;                                                                  
##  [4845] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4846] &quot;\&quot;I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my&quot;      
##  [4847] &quot;head, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you into&quot;       
##  [4848] &quot;the secret, for you are a party concerned.  I dare say you have seen&quot;        
##  [4849] &quot;enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other&quot;     
##  [4850] &quot;profession; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he&quot;         
##  [4851] &quot;can, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be kind&quot;      
##  [4852] &quot;enough to use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some regard&quot;      
##  [4853] &quot;to me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living;&quot;          
##  [4854] &quot;which I understand is a very good one, and the present incumbent not&quot;        
##  [4855] &quot;likely to live a great while.  That would be enough for us to marry&quot;         
##  [4856] &quot;upon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest.\&quot;&quot;                 
##  [4857] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4858] &quot;\&quot;I should always be happy,\&quot; replied Elinor, \&quot;to show any mark of my&quot;      
##  [4859] &quot;esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my&quot;      
##  [4860] &quot;interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary?  He is&quot;         
##  [4861] &quot;brother to Mrs. John Dashwood--THAT must be recommendation enough to&quot;        
##  [4862] &quot;her husband.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [4863] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4864] &quot;\&quot;But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward&#39;s going into&quot;      
##  [4865] &quot;orders.\&quot;&quot;                                                                   
##  [4866] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4867] &quot;\&quot;Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little.\&quot;&quot;            
##  [4868] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4869] &quot;They were again silent for many minutes.  At length Lucy exclaimed with&quot;     
##  [4870] &quot;a deep sigh,&quot;                                                                
##  [4871] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4872] &quot;\&quot;I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at&quot;     
##  [4873] &quot;once by dissolving the engagement.  We seem so beset with difficulties&quot;      
##  [4874] &quot;on every side, that though it would make us miserable for a time, we&quot;        
##  [4875] &quot;should be happier perhaps in the end.  But you will not give me your&quot;        
##  [4876] &quot;advice, Miss Dashwood?\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [4877] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4878] &quot;\&quot;No,\&quot; answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitated&quot;        
##  [4879] &quot;feelings, \&quot;on such a subject I certainly will not.  You know very well&quot;     
##  [4880] &quot;that my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the&quot;        
##  [4881] &quot;side of your wishes.\&quot;&quot;                                                      
##  [4882] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4883] &quot;\&quot;Indeed you wrong me,\&quot; replied Lucy, with great solemnity; \&quot;I know&quot;       
##  [4884] &quot;nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours; and I do&quot;       
##  [4885] &quot;really believe, that if you was to say to me, &#39;I advise you by all&quot;          
##  [4886] &quot;means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will be&quot;      
##  [4887] &quot;more for the happiness of both of you,&#39; I should resolve upon doing it&quot;      
##  [4888] &quot;immediately.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [4889] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4890] &quot;Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward&#39;s future wife, and&quot;             
##  [4891] &quot;replied, \&quot;This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any&quot;    
##  [4892] &quot;opinion on the subject had I formed one.  It raises my influence much&quot;       
##  [4893] &quot;too high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too&quot;      
##  [4894] &quot;much for an indifferent person.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [4895] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4896] &quot;\&quot;&#39;Tis because you are an indifferent person,\&quot; said Lucy, with some&quot;        
##  [4897] &quot;pique, and laying a particular stress on those words, \&quot;that your&quot;           
##  [4898] &quot;judgment might justly have such weight with me.  If you could be&quot;            
##  [4899] &quot;supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your opinion&quot;     
##  [4900] &quot;would not be worth having.\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [4901] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4902] &quot;Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this, lest they might&quot;         
##  [4903] &quot;provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve; and&quot;     
##  [4904] &quot;was even partly determined never to mention the subject again.  Another&quot;     
##  [4905] &quot;pause therefore of many minutes&#39; duration, succeeded this speech, and&quot;       
##  [4906] &quot;Lucy was still the first to end it.&quot;                                         
##  [4907] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4908] &quot;\&quot;Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?\&quot; said she with all&quot;      
##  [4909] &quot;her accustomary complacency.&quot;                                                
##  [4910] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4911] &quot;\&quot;Certainly not.\&quot;&quot;                                                          
##  [4912] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4913] &quot;\&quot;I am sorry for that,\&quot; returned the other, while her eyes brightened at&quot;   
##  [4914] &quot;the information, \&quot;it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you&quot;          
##  [4915] &quot;there!  But I dare say you will go for all that.  To be sure, your&quot;          
##  [4916] &quot;brother and sister will ask you to come to them.\&quot;&quot;                          
##  [4917] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4918] &quot;\&quot;It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do.\&quot;&quot;       
##  [4919] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4920] &quot;\&quot;How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there.&quot;         
##  [4921] &quot;Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who&quot;       
##  [4922] &quot;have been wanting us to visit them these several years!  But I only go&quot;      
##  [4923] &quot;for the sake of seeing Edward.  He will be there in February, otherwise&quot;     
##  [4924] &quot;London would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it.\&quot;&quot;            
##  [4925] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4926] &quot;Elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the first&quot;     
##  [4927] &quot;rubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore&quot;      
##  [4928] &quot;at an end, to which both of them submitted without any reluctance, for&quot;      
##  [4929] &quot;nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other&quot;        
##  [4930] &quot;less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to the card table&quot;       
##  [4931] &quot;with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without&quot;             
##  [4932] &quot;affection for the person who was to be his wife; but that he had not&quot;        
##  [4933] &quot;even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which sincere&quot;         
##  [4934] &quot;affection on HER side would have given, for self-interest alone could&quot;       
##  [4935] &quot;induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which she seemed so&quot;       
##  [4936] &quot;thoroughly aware that he was weary.&quot;                                         
##  [4937] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4938] &quot;From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and when&quot;            
##  [4939] &quot;entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it,&quot;     
##  [4940] &quot;and was particularly careful to inform her confidante, of her happiness&quot;     
##  [4941] &quot;whenever she received a letter from Edward, it was treated by the&quot;           
##  [4942] &quot;former with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility&quot;         
##  [4943] &quot;would allow; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which&quot;      
##  [4944] &quot;Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.&quot;                  
##  [4945] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4946] &quot;The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond&quot;      
##  [4947] &quot;what the first invitation implied.  Their favour increased; they could&quot;      
##  [4948] &quot;not be spared; Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite of&quot;      
##  [4949] &quot;their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of the&quot;     
##  [4950] &quot;absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately, which was&quot;      
##  [4951] &quot;in full force at the end of every week, they were prevailed on to stay&quot;      
##  [4952] &quot;nearly two months at the park, and to assist in the due celebration of&quot;      
##  [4953] &quot;that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private&quot;          
##  [4954] &quot;balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance.&quot;                         
##  [4955] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4956] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4957] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4958] &quot;CHAPTER 25&quot;                                                                  
##  [4959] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4960] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4961] &quot;Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of&quot;        
##  [4962] &quot;the year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not without&quot;     
##  [4963] &quot;a settled habitation of her own.  Since the death of her husband, who&quot;       
##  [4964] &quot;had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town, she had&quot;         
##  [4965] &quot;resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman&quot;          
##  [4966] &quot;Square.  Towards this home, she began on the approach of January to&quot;         
##  [4967] &quot;turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and very&quot;               
##  [4968] &quot;unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her.&quot;     
##  [4969] &quot;Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her sister, and the&quot;     
##  [4970] &quot;animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave&quot;     
##  [4971] &quot;a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she believed herself&quot;      
##  [4972] &quot;to be speaking their united inclinations.  The reason alleged was their&quot;     
##  [4973] &quot;determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the&quot;       
##  [4974] &quot;year.  Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise, and&quot;           
##  [4975] &quot;repeated her invitation immediately.&quot;                                        
##  [4976] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4977] &quot;\&quot;Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I DO beg&quot;     
##  [4978] &quot;you will favour me with your company, for I&#39;ve quite set my heart upon&quot;      
##  [4979] &quot;it.  Don&#39;t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I shan&#39;t&quot;     
##  [4980] &quot;put myself at all out of my way for you.  It will only be sending Betty&quot;     
##  [4981] &quot;by the coach, and I hope I can afford THAT.  We three shall be able to&quot;      
##  [4982] &quot;go very well in my chaise; and when we are in town, if you do not like&quot;      
##  [4983] &quot;to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always go with one of my&quot;        
##  [4984] &quot;daughters.  I am sure your mother will not object to it; for I have had&quot;     
##  [4985] &quot;such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will&quot;        
##  [4986] &quot;think me a very fit person to have the charge of you; and if I don&#39;t&quot;        
##  [4987] &quot;get one of you at least well married before I have done with you, it&quot;        
##  [4988] &quot;shall not be my fault.  I shall speak a good word for you to all the&quot;        
##  [4989] &quot;young men, you may depend upon it.\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [4990] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4991] &quot;\&quot;I have a notion,\&quot; said Sir John, \&quot;that Miss Marianne would not object&quot;   
##  [4992] &quot;to such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it.  It is very&quot;       
##  [4993] &quot;hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because Miss&quot;        
##  [4994] &quot;Dashwood does not wish it.  So I would advise you two, to set off for&quot;       
##  [4995] &quot;town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to Miss&quot;           
##  [4996] &quot;Dashwood about it.\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##  [4997] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [4998] &quot;\&quot;Nay,\&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings, \&quot;I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of&quot;      
##  [4999] &quot;Miss Marianne&#39;s company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only the&quot;     
##  [5000] &quot;more the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable for&quot;      
##  [5001] &quot;them to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk&quot;      
##  [5002] &quot;to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back.  But one or&quot;        
##  [5003] &quot;the other, if not both of them, I must have.  Lord bless me! how do you&quot;     
##  [5004] &quot;think I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used till&quot;         
##  [5005] &quot;this winter to have Charlotte with me.  Come, Miss Marianne, let us&quot;         
##  [5006] &quot;strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her&quot;         
##  [5007] &quot;mind by and bye, why so much the better.\&quot;&quot;                                  
##  [5008] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5009] &quot;\&quot;I thank you, ma&#39;am, sincerely thank you,\&quot; said Marianne, with warmth:&quot;    
##  [5010] &quot;\&quot;your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give&quot;      
##  [5011] &quot;me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of,&quot;      
##  [5012] &quot;to be able to accept it.  But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--I&quot;     
##  [5013] &quot;feel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be made&quot;       
##  [5014] &quot;less happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no, nothing should&quot;         
##  [5015] &quot;tempt me to leave her.  It should not, must not be a struggle.\&quot;&quot;            
##  [5016] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5017] &quot;Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare&quot;         
##  [5018] &quot;them perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and saw&quot;     
##  [5019] &quot;to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her&quot;      
##  [5020] &quot;eagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct&quot;               
##  [5021] &quot;opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her mother&#39;s&quot;              
##  [5022] &quot;decision, from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any&quot;            
##  [5023] &quot;support in her endeavour to prevent a visit, which she could not&quot;            
##  [5024] &quot;approve of for Marianne, and which on her own account she had&quot;               
##  [5025] &quot;particular reasons to avoid.  Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her&quot;        
##  [5026] &quot;mother would be eager to promote--she could not expect to influence the&quot;     
##  [5027] &quot;latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had&quot;     
##  [5028] &quot;never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she dared not explain&quot;     
##  [5029] &quot;the motive of her own disinclination for going to London.  That&quot;             
##  [5030] &quot;Marianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs.&quot;            
##  [5031] &quot;Jennings&#39; manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook&quot;        
##  [5032] &quot;every inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be&quot;         
##  [5033] &quot;most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object,&quot;      
##  [5034] &quot;was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object&quot;      
##  [5035] &quot;to her, as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to&quot;     
##  [5036] &quot;witness.&quot;                                                                    
##  [5037] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5038] &quot;On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that such&quot;     
##  [5039] &quot;an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her&quot;              
##  [5040] &quot;daughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to&quot;         
##  [5041] &quot;herself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of&quot;        
##  [5042] &quot;their declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on their both&quot;          
##  [5043] &quot;accepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usual&quot;            
##  [5044] &quot;cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all,&quot;        
##  [5045] &quot;from this separation.&quot;                                                       
##  [5046] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5047] &quot;\&quot;I am delighted with the plan,\&quot; she cried, \&quot;it is exactly what I could&quot;   
##  [5048] &quot;wish.  Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves.&quot;       
##  [5049] &quot;When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and&quot;         
##  [5050] &quot;happily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret&quot;       
##  [5051] &quot;so improved when you come back again!  I have a little plan of&quot;              
##  [5052] &quot;alteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without&quot;        
##  [5053] &quot;any inconvenience to any one.  It is very right that you SHOULD go to&quot;       
##  [5054] &quot;town; I would have every young woman of your condition in life&quot;              
##  [5055] &quot;acquainted with the manners and amusements of London.  You will be&quot;          
##  [5056] &quot;under the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to&quot;       
##  [5057] &quot;you I can have no doubt.  And in all probability you will see your&quot;          
##  [5058] &quot;brother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,&quot;         
##  [5059] &quot;when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly&quot;        
##  [5060] &quot;estranged from each other.\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [5061] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5062] &quot;\&quot;Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;you&quot;    
##  [5063] &quot;have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which&quot;            
##  [5064] &quot;occurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion,&quot;         
##  [5065] &quot;cannot be so easily removed.\&quot;&quot;                                              
##  [5066] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5067] &quot;Marianne&#39;s countenance sunk.&quot;                                                
##  [5068] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5069] &quot;\&quot;And what,\&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood, \&quot;is my dear prudent Elinor going to&quot;      
##  [5070] &quot;suggest?  What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward?  Do let&quot;     
##  [5071] &quot;me hear a word about the expense of it.\&quot;&quot;                                   
##  [5072] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5073] &quot;\&quot;My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings&#39;s&quot;         
##  [5074] &quot;heart, she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, or&quot;          
##  [5075] &quot;whose protection will give us consequence.\&quot;&quot;                                
##  [5076] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5077] &quot;\&quot;That is very true,\&quot; replied her mother, \&quot;but of her society,&quot;            
##  [5078] &quot;separately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing&quot;      
##  [5079] &quot;at all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady&quot;               
##  [5080] &quot;Middleton.\&quot;&quot;                                                                
##  [5081] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5082] &quot;\&quot;If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings,\&quot; said&quot;      
##  [5083] &quot;Marianne, \&quot;at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation.  I&quot;    
##  [5084] &quot;have no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every&quot;              
##  [5085] &quot;unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort.\&quot;&quot;                      
##  [5086] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5087] &quot;Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards&quot;       
##  [5088] &quot;the manners of a person, to whom she had often had difficulty in&quot;            
##  [5089] &quot;persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolved&quot;       
##  [5090] &quot;within herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would go&quot;         
##  [5091] &quot;likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left&quot;       
##  [5092] &quot;to the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should&quot;      
##  [5093] &quot;be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her&quot;            
##  [5094] &quot;domestic hours.  To this determination she was the more easily&quot;              
##  [5095] &quot;reconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy&#39;s account, was&quot;     
##  [5096] &quot;not to be in town before February; and that their visit, without any&quot;        
##  [5097] &quot;unreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.&quot;                     
##  [5098] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5099] &quot;\&quot;I will have you BOTH go,\&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood; \&quot;these objections are&quot;     
##  [5100] &quot;nonsensical.  You will have much pleasure in being in London, and&quot;           
##  [5101] &quot;especially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to&quot;        
##  [5102] &quot;anticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety of&quot;          
##  [5103] &quot;sources; she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her&quot;                 
##  [5104] &quot;acquaintance with her sister-in-law&#39;s family.\&quot;&quot;                             
##  [5105] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5106] &quot;Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her&quot;      
##  [5107] &quot;mother&#39;s dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the&quot;       
##  [5108] &quot;shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on this&quot;     
##  [5109] &quot;attack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to begin&quot;      
##  [5110] &quot;her design by saying, as calmly as she could, \&quot;I like Edward Ferrars&quot;       
##  [5111] &quot;very much, and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest of&quot;       
##  [5112] &quot;the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me, whether I am&quot;      
##  [5113] &quot;ever known to them or not.\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [5114] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5115] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing.  Marianne lifted up her eyes in&quot;     
##  [5116] &quot;astonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held&quot;       
##  [5117] &quot;her tongue.&quot;                                                                 
##  [5118] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5119] &quot;After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the&quot;        
##  [5120] &quot;invitation should be fully accepted.  Mrs. Jennings received the&quot;            
##  [5121] &quot;information with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness&quot;       
##  [5122] &quot;and care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her.  Sir John was&quot;      
##  [5123] &quot;delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of&quot;          
##  [5124] &quot;being alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in&quot;        
##  [5125] &quot;London, was something.  Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being&quot;       
##  [5126] &quot;delighted, which was putting herself rather out of her way; and as for&quot;      
##  [5127] &quot;the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy in&quot;          
##  [5128] &quot;their lives as this intelligence made them.&quot;                                 
##  [5129] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5130] &quot;Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with&quot;      
##  [5131] &quot;less reluctance than she had expected to feel.  With regard to herself,&quot;     
##  [5132] &quot;it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and&quot;       
##  [5133] &quot;when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her&quot;        
##  [5134] &quot;sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all&quot;        
##  [5135] &quot;her usual animation, and elevated to more than her usual gaiety, she&quot;        
##  [5136] &quot;could not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow&quot;            
##  [5137] &quot;herself to distrust the consequence.&quot;                                        
##  [5138] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5139] &quot;Marianne&#39;s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the&quot;       
##  [5140] &quot;perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone.  Her&quot;             
##  [5141] &quot;unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness;&quot;      
##  [5142] &quot;and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.&quot;         
##  [5143] &quot;Her mother&#39;s affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one of&quot;     
##  [5144] &quot;the three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of&quot;      
##  [5145] &quot;eternal.&quot;                                                                    
##  [5146] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5147] &quot;Their departure took place in the first week in January.  The&quot;               
##  [5148] &quot;Middletons were to follow in about a week.  The Miss Steeles kept their&quot;     
##  [5149] &quot;station at the park, and were to quit it only with the rest of the&quot;          
##  [5150] &quot;family.&quot;                                                                     
##  [5151] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5152] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5153] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5154] &quot;CHAPTER 26&quot;                                                                  
##  [5155] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5156] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5157] &quot;Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and&quot;       
##  [5158] &quot;beginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest,&quot;       
##  [5159] &quot;without wondering at her own situation, so short had their acquaintance&quot;     
##  [5160] &quot;with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age and&quot;                
##  [5161] &quot;disposition, and so many had been her objections against such a measure&quot;     
##  [5162] &quot;only a few days before! But these objections had all, with that happy&quot;       
##  [5163] &quot;ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared, been&quot;          
##  [5164] &quot;overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubt&quot;      
##  [5165] &quot;of Willoughby&#39;s constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightful&quot;      
##  [5166] &quot;expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of&quot;           
##  [5167] &quot;Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect, how cheerless&quot;     
##  [5168] &quot;her own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she would&quot;           
##  [5169] &quot;engage in the solicitude of Marianne&#39;s situation to have the same&quot;           
##  [5170] &quot;animating object in view, the same possibility of hope.  A short, a&quot;         
##  [5171] &quot;very short time however must now decide what Willoughby&#39;s intentions&quot;        
##  [5172] &quot;were; in all probability he was already in town.  Marianne&#39;s eagerness&quot;      
##  [5173] &quot;to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there; and Elinor was&quot;     
##  [5174] &quot;resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character&quot;          
##  [5175] &quot;which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,&quot;     
##  [5176] &quot;but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such&quot;            
##  [5177] &quot;zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he meant,&quot;           
##  [5178] &quot;before many meetings had taken place.  Should the result of her&quot;             
##  [5179] &quot;observations be unfavourable, she was determined at all events to open&quot;      
##  [5180] &quot;the eyes of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions would be&quot;      
##  [5181] &quot;of a different nature--she must then learn to avoid every selfish&quot;           
##  [5182] &quot;comparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction&quot;     
##  [5183] &quot;in the happiness of Marianne.&quot;                                               
##  [5184] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5185] &quot;They were three days on their journey, and Marianne&#39;s behaviour as they&quot;     
##  [5186] &quot;travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and&quot;              
##  [5187] &quot;companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be.  She sat in&quot;     
##  [5188] &quot;silence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely&quot;      
##  [5189] &quot;ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty&quot;     
##  [5190] &quot;within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively&quot;       
##  [5191] &quot;addressed to her sister.  To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinor&quot;       
##  [5192] &quot;took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had&quot;             
##  [5193] &quot;assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,&quot;     
##  [5194] &quot;talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever she&quot;         
##  [5195] &quot;could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with all&quot;             
##  [5196] &quot;possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and&quot;      
##  [5197] &quot;enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their&quot;     
##  [5198] &quot;own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferring&quot;         
##  [5199] &quot;salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets.  They reached town by&quot;       
##  [5200] &quot;three o&#39;clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey,&quot;     
##  [5201] &quot;from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury&quot;       
##  [5202] &quot;of a good fire.&quot;                                                             
##  [5203] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5204] &quot;The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young ladies&quot;      
##  [5205] &quot;were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment.  It&quot;     
##  [5206] &quot;had formerly been Charlotte&#39;s, and over the mantelpiece still hung a&quot;        
##  [5207] &quot;landscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof of her having&quot;      
##  [5208] &quot;spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect.&quot;                 
##  [5209] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5210] &quot;As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their&quot;             
##  [5211] &quot;arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her&quot;         
##  [5212] &quot;mother, and sat down for that purpose.  In a few moments Marianne did&quot;       
##  [5213] &quot;the same.  \&quot;I am writing home, Marianne,\&quot; said Elinor; \&quot;had not you&quot;      
##  [5214] &quot;better defer your letter for a day or two?\&quot;&quot;                                
##  [5215] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5216] &quot;\&quot;I am NOT going to write to my mother,\&quot; replied Marianne, hastily, and&quot;    
##  [5217] &quot;as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry.  Elinor said no more; it&quot;        
##  [5218] &quot;immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby; and&quot;     
##  [5219] &quot;the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however&quot;               
##  [5220] &quot;mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be&quot;            
##  [5221] &quot;engaged.  This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her&quot;       
##  [5222] &quot;pleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.&quot;               
##  [5223] &quot;Marianne&#39;s was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be no&quot;     
##  [5224] &quot;more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with&quot;          
##  [5225] &quot;eager rapidity.  Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the&quot;      
##  [5226] &quot;direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the&quot;         
##  [5227] &quot;bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed&quot;     
##  [5228] &quot;for her to the two-penny post.  This decided the matter at once.&quot;            
##  [5229] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5230] &quot;Her spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them&quot;      
##  [5231] &quot;which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and this&quot;          
##  [5232] &quot;agitation increased as the evening drew on.  She could scarcely eat any&quot;     
##  [5233] &quot;dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed&quot;       
##  [5234] &quot;anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.&quot;                         
##  [5235] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5236] &quot;It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much&quot;     
##  [5237] &quot;engaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing.  The tea&quot;     
##  [5238] &quot;things were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed more&quot;     
##  [5239] &quot;than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly&quot;     
##  [5240] &quot;heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinor&quot;        
##  [5241] &quot;felt secure of its announcing Willoughby&#39;s approach, and Marianne,&quot;          
##  [5242] &quot;starting up, moved towards the door.  Every thing was silent; this&quot;          
##  [5243] &quot;could not be borne many seconds; she opened the door, advanced a few&quot;        
##  [5244] &quot;steps towards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returned&quot;       
##  [5245] &quot;into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard&quot;       
##  [5246] &quot;him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that&quot;         
##  [5247] &quot;instant she could not help exclaiming, \&quot;Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby,&quot;      
##  [5248] &quot;indeed it is!\&quot; and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms,&quot;     
##  [5249] &quot;when Colonel Brandon appeared.&quot;                                              
##  [5250] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5251] &quot;It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she immediately&quot;     
##  [5252] &quot;left the room.  Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time her&quot;       
##  [5253] &quot;regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her; and she felt&quot;       
##  [5254] &quot;particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive&quot;       
##  [5255] &quot;that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing&quot;         
##  [5256] &quot;him.  She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he even&quot;      
##  [5257] &quot;observed Marianne as she quitted the room, with such astonishment and&quot;       
##  [5258] &quot;concern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded&quot;      
##  [5259] &quot;towards herself.&quot;                                                            
##  [5260] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5261] &quot;\&quot;Is your sister ill?\&quot; said he.&quot;                                            
##  [5262] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5263] &quot;Elinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of&quot;           
##  [5264] &quot;head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to which&quot;     
##  [5265] &quot;she could decently attribute her sister&#39;s behaviour.&quot;                        
##  [5266] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5267] &quot;He heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect&quot;      
##  [5268] &quot;himself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of&quot;        
##  [5269] &quot;his pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries about&quot;     
##  [5270] &quot;their journey, and the friends they had left behind.&quot;                        
##  [5271] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5272] &quot;In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,&quot;         
##  [5273] &quot;they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts&quot;       
##  [5274] &quot;of both engaged elsewhere.  Elinor wished very much to ask whether&quot;          
##  [5275] &quot;Willoughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by&quot;      
##  [5276] &quot;any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying something,&quot;     
##  [5277] &quot;she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last.&quot;        
##  [5278] &quot;\&quot;Yes,\&quot; he replied, with some embarrassment, \&quot;almost ever since; I have&quot;   
##  [5279] &quot;been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been in&quot;     
##  [5280] &quot;my power to return to Barton.\&quot;&quot;                                             
##  [5281] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5282] &quot;This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to&quot;      
##  [5283] &quot;her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, with&quot;      
##  [5284] &quot;the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and she&quot;     
##  [5285] &quot;was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the&quot;        
##  [5286] &quot;subject than she had ever felt.&quot;                                             
##  [5287] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5288] &quot;Mrs. Jennings soon came in.  \&quot;Oh! Colonel,\&quot; said she, with her usual&quot;      
##  [5289] &quot;noisy cheerfulness, \&quot;I am monstrous glad to see you--sorry I could not&quot;     
##  [5290] &quot;come before--beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a&quot;     
##  [5291] &quot;little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have been&quot;     
##  [5292] &quot;at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do&quot;     
##  [5293] &quot;after one has been away for any time; and then I have had Cartwright to&quot;     
##  [5294] &quot;settle with-- Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!&quot;         
##  [5295] &quot;But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should be in town&quot;     
##  [5296] &quot;today?\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
##  [5297] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5298] &quot;\&quot;I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer&#39;s, where I have been&quot;       
##  [5299] &quot;dining.\&quot;&quot;                                                                   
##  [5300] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5301] &quot;\&quot;Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house?  How does&quot;       
##  [5302] &quot;Charlotte do?  I warrant you she is a fine size by this time.\&quot;&quot;             
##  [5303] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5304] &quot;\&quot;Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you,&quot;       
##  [5305] &quot;that you will certainly see her to-morrow.\&quot;&quot;                                
##  [5306] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5307] &quot;\&quot;Ay, to be sure, I thought as much.  Well, Colonel, I have brought two&quot;     
##  [5308] &quot;young ladies with me, you see--that is, you see but one of them now,&quot;        
##  [5309] &quot;but there is another somewhere.  Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which&quot;     
##  [5310] &quot;you will not be sorry to hear.  I do not know what you and Mr.&quot;              
##  [5311] &quot;Willoughby will do between you about her.  Ay, it is a fine thing to be&quot;     
##  [5312] &quot;young and handsome.  Well! I was young once, but I never was very&quot;           
##  [5313] &quot;handsome--worse luck for me.  However, I got a very good husband, and I&quot;     
##  [5314] &quot;don&#39;t know what the greatest beauty can do more.  Ah! poor man! he has&quot;      
##  [5315] &quot;been dead these eight years and better.  But Colonel, where have you&quot;        
##  [5316] &quot;been to since we parted?  And how does your business go on?  Come,&quot;          
##  [5317] &quot;come, let&#39;s have no secrets among friends.\&quot;&quot;                                
##  [5318] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5319] &quot;He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but&quot;          
##  [5320] &quot;without satisfying her in any.  Elinor now began to make the tea, and&quot;       
##  [5321] &quot;Marianne was obliged to appear again.&quot;                                       
##  [5322] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5323] &quot;After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent&quot;       
##  [5324] &quot;than he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to&quot;      
##  [5325] &quot;stay long.  No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were&quot;     
##  [5326] &quot;unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.&quot;                                   
##  [5327] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5328] &quot;Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.&quot;      
##  [5329] &quot;The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the&quot;            
##  [5330] &quot;expectation of what was to happen that day.  They had not long finished&quot;     
##  [5331] &quot;their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer&#39;s barouche stopped at the door, and&quot;      
##  [5332] &quot;in a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to see&quot;       
##  [5333] &quot;them all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure&quot;        
##  [5334] &quot;from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again.  So surprised at&quot;       
##  [5335] &quot;their coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected all&quot;        
##  [5336] &quot;along; so angry at their accepting her mother&#39;s invitation after having&quot;     
##  [5337] &quot;declined her own, though at the same time she would never have forgiven&quot;     
##  [5338] &quot;them if they had not come!&quot;                                                  
##  [5339] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5340] &quot;\&quot;Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,\&quot; said she; \&quot;What do you think&quot;   
##  [5341] &quot;he said when he heard of your coming with Mama?  I forget what it was&quot;       
##  [5342] &quot;now, but it was something so droll!\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [5343] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5344] &quot;After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat,&quot;      
##  [5345] &quot;or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their&quot;         
##  [5346] &quot;acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings&#39;s side, and in laughter without cause on&quot;      
##  [5347] &quot;Mrs. Palmer&#39;s, it was proposed by the latter that they should all&quot;           
##  [5348] &quot;accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning, to&quot;         
##  [5349] &quot;which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise&quot;        
##  [5350] &quot;some purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it at&quot;     
##  [5351] &quot;first was induced to go likewise.&quot;                                           
##  [5352] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5353] &quot;Wherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch.  In Bond&quot;         
##  [5354] &quot;Street especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in&quot;       
##  [5355] &quot;constant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind&quot;     
##  [5356] &quot;was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from all&quot;      
##  [5357] &quot;that interested and occupied the others.  Restless and dissatisfied&quot;         
##  [5358] &quot;every where, her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article&quot;       
##  [5359] &quot;of purchase, however it might equally concern them both: she received&quot;       
##  [5360] &quot;no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at home again, and&quot;      
##  [5361] &quot;could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs.&quot;        
##  [5362] &quot;Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing pretty, expensive, or new;&quot;      
##  [5363] &quot;who was wild to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her&quot;      
##  [5364] &quot;time in rapture and indecision.&quot;                                             
##  [5365] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5366] &quot;It was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner had&quot;     
##  [5367] &quot;they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and when&quot;       
##  [5368] &quot;Elinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful&quot;      
##  [5369] &quot;countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there.&quot;              
##  [5370] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5371] &quot;\&quot;Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?\&quot; said she to&quot;      
##  [5372] &quot;the footman who then entered with the parcels.  She was answered in the&quot;     
##  [5373] &quot;negative.  \&quot;Are you quite sure of it?\&quot; she replied.  \&quot;Are you certain&quot;    
##  [5374] &quot;that no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?\&quot;&quot;                   
##  [5375] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5376] &quot;The man replied that none had.&quot;                                              
##  [5377] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5378] &quot;\&quot;How very odd!\&quot; said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as she&quot;         
##  [5379] &quot;turned away to the window.&quot;                                                  
##  [5380] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5381] &quot;\&quot;How odd, indeed!\&quot; repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her sister&quot;   
##  [5382] &quot;with uneasiness.  \&quot;If she had not known him to be in town she would not&quot;    
##  [5383] &quot;have written to him, as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna;&quot;     
##  [5384] &quot;and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come nor write!&quot;        
##  [5385] &quot;Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an engagement&quot;           
##  [5386] &quot;between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be carried on in&quot;     
##  [5387] &quot;so doubtful, so mysterious a manner!  I long to inquire; and how will&quot;       
##  [5388] &quot;MY interference be borne.\&quot;&quot;                                                 
##  [5389] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5390] &quot;She determined, after some consideration, that if appearances continued&quot;     
##  [5391] &quot;many days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would represent in&quot;     
##  [5392] &quot;the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious&quot;            
##  [5393] &quot;enquiry into the affair.&quot;                                                    
##  [5394] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5395] &quot;Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings&#39;s intimate&quot;              
##  [5396] &quot;acquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined with&quot;       
##  [5397] &quot;them.  The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening&quot;           
##  [5398] &quot;engagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table&quot;       
##  [5399] &quot;for the others.  Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she&quot;          
##  [5400] &quot;would never learn the game; but though her time was therefore at her&quot;        
##  [5401] &quot;own disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure&quot;       
##  [5402] &quot;to her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of&quot;               
##  [5403] &quot;expectation and the pain of disappointment.  She sometimes endeavoured&quot;      
##  [5404] &quot;for a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she&quot;      
##  [5405] &quot;returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and&quot;        
##  [5406] &quot;forwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to the&quot;     
##  [5407] &quot;window, in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.&quot;                   
##  [5408] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5409] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5410] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5411] &quot;CHAPTER 27&quot;                                                                  
##  [5412] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5413] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5414] &quot;\&quot;If this open weather holds much longer,\&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, when they&quot;   
##  [5415] &quot;met at breakfast the following morning, \&quot;Sir John will not like leaving&quot;    
##  [5416] &quot;Barton next week; &#39;tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day&#39;s&quot;            
##  [5417] &quot;pleasure.  Poor souls!  I always pity them when they do; they seem to&quot;       
##  [5418] &quot;take it so much to heart.\&quot;&quot;                                                 
##  [5419] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5420] &quot;\&quot;That is true,\&quot; cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to the&quot;   
##  [5421] &quot;window as she spoke, to examine the day.  \&quot;I had not thought of that.&quot;      
##  [5422] &quot;This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country.\&quot;&quot;                     
##  [5423] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5424] &quot;It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it.&quot;      
##  [5425] &quot;\&quot;It is charming weather for THEM indeed,\&quot; she continued, as she sat&quot;       
##  [5426] &quot;down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance.  \&quot;How much they&quot;      
##  [5427] &quot;must enjoy it! But\&quot; (with a little return of anxiety) \&quot;it cannot be&quot;       
##  [5428] &quot;expected to last long.  At this time of the year, and after such a&quot;          
##  [5429] &quot;series of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it.  Frosts&quot;     
##  [5430] &quot;will soon set in, and in all probability with severity.  In another day&quot;     
##  [5431] &quot;or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer--nay,&quot;          
##  [5432] &quot;perhaps it may freeze tonight!\&quot;&quot;                                            
##  [5433] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5434] &quot;\&quot;At any rate,\&quot; said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from&quot;         
##  [5435] &quot;seeing her sister&#39;s thoughts as clearly as she did, \&quot;I dare say we&quot;         
##  [5436] &quot;shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week.\&quot;&quot;   
##  [5437] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5438] &quot;\&quot;Ay, my dear, I&#39;ll warrant you we do.  Mary always has her own way.\&quot;&quot;      
##  [5439] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5440] &quot;\&quot;And now,\&quot; silently conjectured Elinor, \&quot;she will write to Combe by&quot;      
##  [5441] &quot;this day&#39;s post.\&quot;&quot;                                                          
##  [5442] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5443] &quot;But if she DID, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy&quot;         
##  [5444] &quot;which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact.  Whatever the&quot;      
##  [5445] &quot;truth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough&quot;           
##  [5446] &quot;contentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could&quot;      
##  [5447] &quot;not be very uncomfortable herself.  And Marianne was in spirits; happy&quot;      
##  [5448] &quot;in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation of&quot;     
##  [5449] &quot;a frost.&quot;                                                                    
##  [5450] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5451] &quot;The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs.&quot;        
##  [5452] &quot;Jennings&#39;s acquaintance to inform them of her being in town; and&quot;            
##  [5453] &quot;Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind,&quot;      
##  [5454] &quot;watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the&quot;       
##  [5455] &quot;air.&quot;                                                                        
##  [5456] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5457] &quot;\&quot;Don&#39;t you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There&quot;        
##  [5458] &quot;seems to me a very decided difference.  I can hardly keep my hands warm&quot;     
##  [5459] &quot;even in my muff.  It was not so yesterday, I think.  The clouds seem&quot;        
##  [5460] &quot;parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a clear&quot;     
##  [5461] &quot;afternoon.\&quot;&quot;                                                                
##  [5462] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5463] &quot;Elinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered,&quot;        
##  [5464] &quot;and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning in&quot;     
##  [5465] &quot;the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching&quot;       
##  [5466] &quot;frost.&quot;                                                                      
##  [5467] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5468] &quot;The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.&quot;       
##  [5469] &quot;Jennings&#39;s style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her&quot;          
##  [5470] &quot;behaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind.  Every thing in her&quot;     
##  [5471] &quot;household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and&quot;          
##  [5472] &quot;excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton&#39;s regret, she&quot;     
##  [5473] &quot;had never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction could at&quot;      
##  [5474] &quot;all discompose the feelings of her young companions.  Pleased to find&quot;       
##  [5475] &quot;herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had&quot;           
##  [5476] &quot;expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real&quot;     
##  [5477] &quot;enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or&quot;      
##  [5478] &quot;abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.&quot;              
##  [5479] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5480] &quot;Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with&quot;        
##  [5481] &quot;them almost every day; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,&quot;      
##  [5482] &quot;who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from&quot;      
##  [5483] &quot;any other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much&quot;          
##  [5484] &quot;concern his continued regard for her sister.  She feared it was a&quot;           
##  [5485] &quot;strengthening regard.  It grieved her to see the earnestness with which&quot;     
##  [5486] &quot;he often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse than&quot;        
##  [5487] &quot;when at Barton.&quot;                                                             
##  [5488] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5489] &quot;About a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby was&quot;     
##  [5490] &quot;also arrived.  His card was on the table when they came in from the&quot;         
##  [5491] &quot;morning&#39;s drive.&quot;                                                            
##  [5492] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5493] &quot;\&quot;Good God!\&quot; cried Marianne, \&quot;he has been here while we were out.\&quot;&quot;       
##  [5494] &quot;Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his being in London, now ventured to&quot;      
##  [5495] &quot;say, \&quot;Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow.\&quot;  But Marianne&quot;         
##  [5496] &quot;seemed hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings&#39;s entrance, escaped with&quot;    
##  [5497] &quot;the precious card.&quot;                                                          
##  [5498] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5499] &quot;This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those of&quot;     
##  [5500] &quot;her sister all, and more than all, their former agitation.  From this&quot;       
##  [5501] &quot;moment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every&quot;        
##  [5502] &quot;hour of the day, made her unfit for any thing.  She insisted on being&quot;       
##  [5503] &quot;left behind, the next morning, when the others went out.&quot;                    
##  [5504] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5505] &quot;Elinor&#39;s thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street&quot;     
##  [5506] &quot;during their absence; but a moment&#39;s glance at her sister when they&quot;         
##  [5507] &quot;returned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second&quot;       
##  [5508] &quot;visit there.  A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table.&quot;       
##  [5509] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5510] &quot;\&quot;For me!\&quot; cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.&quot;                       
##  [5511] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5512] &quot;\&quot;No, ma&#39;am, for my mistress.\&quot;&quot;                                             
##  [5513] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5514] &quot;But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.&quot;                          
##  [5515] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5516] &quot;\&quot;It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!\&quot;&quot;                          
##  [5517] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5518] &quot;\&quot;You are expecting a letter, then?\&quot; said Elinor, unable to be longer&quot;      
##  [5519] &quot;silent.&quot;                                                                     
##  [5520] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5521] &quot;\&quot;Yes, a little--not much.\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [5522] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5523] &quot;After a short pause.  \&quot;You have no confidence in me, Marianne.\&quot;&quot;           
##  [5524] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5525] &quot;\&quot;Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who have confidence in no&quot;        
##  [5526] &quot;one!\&quot;&quot;                                                                      
##  [5527] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5528] &quot;\&quot;Me!\&quot; returned Elinor in some confusion; \&quot;indeed, Marianne, I have&quot;       
##  [5529] &quot;nothing to tell.\&quot;&quot;                                                          
##  [5530] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5531] &quot;\&quot;Nor I,\&quot; answered Marianne with energy, \&quot;our situations then are alike.&quot;  
##  [5532] &quot;We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do not&quot;            
##  [5533] &quot;communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing.\&quot;&quot;                            
##  [5534] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5535] &quot;Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she was&quot;      
##  [5536] &quot;not at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to&quot;       
##  [5537] &quot;press for greater openness in Marianne.&quot;                                     
##  [5538] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5539] &quot;Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it&quot;      
##  [5540] &quot;aloud.  It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit&quot;     
##  [5541] &quot;Street the night before, and requesting the company of her mother and&quot;       
##  [5542] &quot;cousins the following evening.  Business on Sir John&#39;s part, and a&quot;          
##  [5543] &quot;violent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.&quot;        
##  [5544] &quot;The invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drew&quot;          
##  [5545] &quot;near, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that&quot;         
##  [5546] &quot;they should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some difficulty&quot;     
##  [5547] &quot;in persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen nothing of&quot;           
##  [5548] &quot;Willoughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad,&quot;     
##  [5549] &quot;than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.&quot;         
##  [5550] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5551] &quot;Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not&quot;            
##  [5552] &quot;materially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled&quot;      
##  [5553] &quot;in town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty&quot;        
##  [5554] &quot;young people, and to amuse them with a ball.  This was an affair,&quot;           
##  [5555] &quot;however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve.  In the country, an&quot;       
##  [5556] &quot;unpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the&quot;           
##  [5557] &quot;reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it&quot;      
##  [5558] &quot;was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it&quot;       
##  [5559] &quot;known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine&quot;          
##  [5560] &quot;couple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.&quot;                  
##  [5561] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5562] &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had&quot;       
##  [5563] &quot;not seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to avoid&quot;     
##  [5564] &quot;the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and therefore&quot;         
##  [5565] &quot;never came near her, they received no mark of recognition on their&quot;          
##  [5566] &quot;entrance.  He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know who they&quot;     
##  [5567] &quot;were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the&quot;         
##  [5568] &quot;room.  Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered: it&quot;      
##  [5569] &quot;was enough--HE was not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed to&quot;     
##  [5570] &quot;receive or communicate pleasure.  After they had been assembled about&quot;       
##  [5571] &quot;an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his&quot;     
##  [5572] &quot;surprise on seeing them in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first&quot;      
##  [5573] &quot;informed of their arrival at his house, and he had himself said&quot;             
##  [5574] &quot;something very droll on hearing that they were to come.&quot;                     
##  [5575] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5576] &quot;\&quot;I thought you were both in Devonshire,\&quot; said he.&quot;                         
##  [5577] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5578] &quot;\&quot;Did you?\&quot; replied Elinor.&quot;                                                
##  [5579] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5580] &quot;\&quot;When do you go back again?\&quot;&quot;                                              
##  [5581] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5582] &quot;\&quot;I do not know.\&quot; And thus ended their discourse.&quot;                          
##  [5583] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5584] &quot;Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she was&quot;       
##  [5585] &quot;that evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise.  She&quot;              
##  [5586] &quot;complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street.&quot;                       
##  [5587] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5588] &quot;\&quot;Aye, aye,\&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, \&quot;we know the reason of all that very&quot;     
##  [5589] &quot;well; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you&quot;        
##  [5590] &quot;would not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very&quot;       
##  [5591] &quot;pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.\&quot;&quot;            
##  [5592] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5593] &quot;\&quot;Invited!\&quot; cried Marianne.&quot;                                                
##  [5594] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5595] &quot;\&quot;So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him&quot;           
##  [5596] &quot;somewhere in the street this morning.\&quot; Marianne said no more, but&quot;          
##  [5597] &quot;looked exceedingly hurt.  Impatient in this situation to be doing&quot;           
##  [5598] &quot;something that might lead to her sister&#39;s relief, Elinor resolved to&quot;        
##  [5599] &quot;write the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fears&quot;      
##  [5600] &quot;for the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been&quot;       
##  [5601] &quot;so long delayed; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by&quot;     
##  [5602] &quot;perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again&quot;           
##  [5603] &quot;writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose it to be to any other&quot;      
##  [5604] &quot;person.&quot;                                                                     
##  [5605] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5606] &quot;About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on&quot;           
##  [5607] &quot;business, and Elinor began her letter directly, while Marianne, too&quot;         
##  [5608] &quot;restless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one&quot;      
##  [5609] &quot;window to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.&quot;      
##  [5610] &quot;Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating all&quot;      
##  [5611] &quot;that had passed, her suspicions of Willoughby&#39;s inconstancy, urging her&quot;     
##  [5612] &quot;by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account&quot;      
##  [5613] &quot;of her real situation with respect to him.&quot;                                  
##  [5614] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5615] &quot;Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and&quot;        
##  [5616] &quot;Colonel Brandon was announced.  Marianne, who had seen him from the&quot;         
##  [5617] &quot;window, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he&quot;          
##  [5618] &quot;entered it.  He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing&quot;       
##  [5619] &quot;satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat in&quot;       
##  [5620] &quot;particular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word.&quot;            
##  [5621] &quot;Elinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her&quot;       
##  [5622] &quot;sister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening.  It was not the&quot;     
##  [5623] &quot;first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more than&quot;       
##  [5624] &quot;once before, beginning with the observation of \&quot;your sister looks&quot;          
##  [5625] &quot;unwell to-day,\&quot; or \&quot;your sister seems out of spirits,\&quot; he had appeared&quot;   
##  [5626] &quot;on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring, something&quot;              
##  [5627] &quot;particular about her.  After a pause of several minutes, their silence&quot;      
##  [5628] &quot;was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he was&quot;     
##  [5629] &quot;to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother?  Elinor was not&quot;        
##  [5630] &quot;prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obliged&quot;       
##  [5631] &quot;to adopt the simple and common expedient, of asking what he meant?  He&quot;      
##  [5632] &quot;tried to smile as he replied, \&quot;your sister&#39;s engagement to Mr.&quot;             
##  [5633] &quot;Willoughby is very generally known.\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [5634] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5635] &quot;\&quot;It cannot be generally known,\&quot; returned Elinor, \&quot;for her own family do&quot;  
##  [5636] &quot;not know it.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [5637] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5638] &quot;He looked surprised and said, \&quot;I beg your pardon, I am afraid my&quot;           
##  [5639] &quot;inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy&quot;            
##  [5640] &quot;intended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally&quot;      
##  [5641] &quot;talked of.\&quot;&quot;                                                                
##  [5642] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5643] &quot;\&quot;How can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?\&quot;&quot;               
##  [5644] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5645] &quot;\&quot;By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you are&quot;    
##  [5646] &quot;most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons.  But&quot;         
##  [5647] &quot;still I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps&quot;           
##  [5648] &quot;rather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to&quot;          
##  [5649] &quot;support its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,&quot;         
##  [5650] &quot;accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in&quot;       
##  [5651] &quot;your sister&#39;s writing.  I came to inquire, but I was convinced before I&quot;     
##  [5652] &quot;could ask the question.  Is every thing finally settled?  Is it&quot;             
##  [5653] &quot;impossible to-?  But I have no right, and I could have no chance of&quot;         
##  [5654] &quot;succeeding.  Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.  I believe I have been wrong in&quot;      
##  [5655] &quot;saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I&quot;        
##  [5656] &quot;have the strongest dependence.  Tell me that it is all absolutely&quot;           
##  [5657] &quot;resolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if&quot;                
##  [5658] &quot;concealment be possible, is all that remains.\&quot;&quot;                             
##  [5659] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5660] &quot;These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for&quot;       
##  [5661] &quot;her sister, affected her very much.  She was not immediately able to&quot;        
##  [5662] &quot;say anything, and even when her spirits were recovered, she debated for&quot;     
##  [5663] &quot;a short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give.  The real&quot;      
##  [5664] &quot;state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known&quot;       
##  [5665] &quot;to herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as liable&quot;      
##  [5666] &quot;to say too much as too little.  Yet as she was convinced that&quot;               
##  [5667] &quot;Marianne&#39;s affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel&quot;         
##  [5668] &quot;Brandon&#39;s success, whatever the event of that affection might be, and&quot;       
##  [5669] &quot;at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure, she thought&quot;     
##  [5670] &quot;it most prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say more than&quot;        
##  [5671] &quot;she really knew or believed.  She acknowledged, therefore, that though&quot;      
##  [5672] &quot;she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they&quot;        
##  [5673] &quot;stood with each other, of their mutual affection she had no doubt, and&quot;      
##  [5674] &quot;of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear.&quot;                     
##  [5675] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5676] &quot;He listened to her with silent attention, and on her ceasing to speak,&quot;      
##  [5677] &quot;rose directly from his seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion,&quot;        
##  [5678] &quot;\&quot;to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he&quot;     
##  [5679] &quot;may endeavour to deserve her,\&quot;--took leave, and went away.&quot;                 
##  [5680] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5681] &quot;Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, to&quot;           
##  [5682] &quot;lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points; she was left, on the&quot;     
##  [5683] &quot;contrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon&#39;s&quot;                 
##  [5684] &quot;unhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by her&quot;         
##  [5685] &quot;anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.&quot;                            
##  [5686] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5687] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5688] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5689] &quot;CHAPTER 28&quot;                                                                  
##  [5690] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5691] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5692] &quot;Nothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor&quot;         
##  [5693] &quot;regret what she had done, in applying to her mother; for Willoughby&quot;         
##  [5694] &quot;neither came nor wrote.  They were engaged about the end of that time&quot;       
##  [5695] &quot;to attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept&quot;      
##  [5696] &quot;away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this party,&quot;     
##  [5697] &quot;Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and seeming&quot;        
##  [5698] &quot;equally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared, without one&quot;        
##  [5699] &quot;look of hope or one expression of pleasure.  She sat by the&quot;                 
##  [5700] &quot;drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton&#39;s&quot;            
##  [5701] &quot;arrival, without once stirring from her seat, or altering her attitude,&quot;     
##  [5702] &quot;lost in her own thoughts, and insensible of her sister&#39;s presence; and&quot;      
##  [5703] &quot;when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the&quot;      
##  [5704] &quot;door, she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected.&quot;        
##  [5705] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5706] &quot;They arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as&quot;        
##  [5707] &quot;the string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended the&quot;     
##  [5708] &quot;stairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to another&quot;       
##  [5709] &quot;in an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up, quite full&quot;       
##  [5710] &quot;of company, and insufferably hot.  When they had paid their tribute of&quot;      
##  [5711] &quot;politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were permitted&quot;       
##  [5712] &quot;to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and&quot;                
##  [5713] &quot;inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add.  After some&quot;     
##  [5714] &quot;time spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to&quot;       
##  [5715] &quot;Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she and&quot;       
##  [5716] &quot;Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great&quot;          
##  [5717] &quot;distance from the table.&quot;                                                    
##  [5718] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5719] &quot;They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived&quot;          
##  [5720] &quot;Willoughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest&quot;                 
##  [5721] &quot;conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman.  She soon&quot;         
##  [5722] &quot;caught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting to&quot;         
##  [5723] &quot;speak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her;&quot;     
##  [5724] &quot;and then continued his discourse with the same lady.  Elinor turned&quot;         
##  [5725] &quot;involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved by&quot;         
##  [5726] &quot;her.  At that moment she first perceived him, and her whole countenance&quot;     
##  [5727] &quot;glowing with sudden delight, she would have moved towards him&quot;               
##  [5728] &quot;instantly, had not her sister caught hold of her.&quot;                           
##  [5729] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5730] &quot;\&quot;Good heavens!\&quot; she exclaimed, \&quot;he is there--he is there--Oh! why does&quot;   
##  [5731] &quot;he not look at me? why cannot I speak to him?\&quot;&quot;                             
##  [5732] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5733] &quot;\&quot;Pray, pray be composed,\&quot; cried Elinor, \&quot;and do not betray what you&quot;      
##  [5734] &quot;feel to every body present.  Perhaps he has not observed you yet.\&quot;&quot;         
##  [5735] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5736] &quot;This however was more than she could believe herself; and to be&quot;             
##  [5737] &quot;composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne, it&quot;     
##  [5738] &quot;was beyond her wish.  She sat in an agony of impatience which affected&quot;      
##  [5739] &quot;every feature.&quot;                                                              
##  [5740] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5741] &quot;At last he turned round again, and regarded them both; she started up,&quot;      
##  [5742] &quot;and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection, held out her hand to&quot;       
##  [5743] &quot;him.  He approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor than&quot;           
##  [5744] &quot;Marianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to observe&quot;     
##  [5745] &quot;her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, and&quot;         
##  [5746] &quot;asked how long they had been in town.  Elinor was robbed of all&quot;             
##  [5747] &quot;presence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a word.  But&quot;     
##  [5748] &quot;the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed.  Her face was&quot;          
##  [5749] &quot;crimsoned over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,&quot;      
##  [5750] &quot;\&quot;Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?  Have you not&quot;          
##  [5751] &quot;received my letters?  Will you not shake hands with me?\&quot;&quot;                   
##  [5752] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5753] &quot;He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and he&quot;     
##  [5754] &quot;held her hand only for a moment.  During all this time he was evidently&quot;     
##  [5755] &quot;struggling for composure.  Elinor watched his countenance and saw its&quot;       
##  [5756] &quot;expression becoming more tranquil.  After a moment&#39;s pause, he spoke&quot;        
##  [5757] &quot;with calmness.&quot;                                                              
##  [5758] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5759] &quot;\&quot;I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,&quot;       
##  [5760] &quot;and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find&quot;             
##  [5761] &quot;yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home.  My card was not lost, I hope.\&quot;&quot;      
##  [5762] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5763] &quot;\&quot;But have you not received my notes?\&quot; cried Marianne in the wildest&quot;       
##  [5764] &quot;anxiety.  \&quot;Here is some mistake I am sure--some dreadful mistake.  What&quot;    
##  [5765] &quot;can be the meaning of it?  Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven&#39;s sake tell&quot;      
##  [5766] &quot;me, what is the matter?\&quot;&quot;                                                   
##  [5767] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5768] &quot;He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment&quot;          
##  [5769] &quot;returned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he&quot;     
##  [5770] &quot;had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant exertion,&quot;     
##  [5771] &quot;he recovered himself again, and after saying, \&quot;Yes, I had the pleasure&quot;     
##  [5772] &quot;of receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were so&quot;     
##  [5773] &quot;good as to send me,\&quot; turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined&quot;      
##  [5774] &quot;his friend.&quot;                                                                 
##  [5775] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5776] &quot;Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into&quot;      
##  [5777] &quot;her chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her faint, tried&quot;       
##  [5778] &quot;to screen her from the observation of others, while reviving her with&quot;       
##  [5779] &quot;lavender water.&quot;                                                             
##  [5780] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5781] &quot;\&quot;Go to him, Elinor,\&quot; she cried, as soon as she could speak, \&quot;and force&quot;   
##  [5782] &quot;him to come to me.  Tell him I must see him again--must speak to him&quot;        
##  [5783] &quot;instantly.-- I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment&#39;s peace till this&quot;     
##  [5784] &quot;is explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.-- Oh go to him&quot;        
##  [5785] &quot;this moment.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [5786] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5787] &quot;\&quot;How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait.  This is&quot;    
##  [5788] &quot;not the place for explanations.  Wait only till tomorrow.\&quot;&quot;                 
##  [5789] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5790] &quot;With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him&quot;            
##  [5791] &quot;herself; and to persuade her to check her agitation, to wait, at least,&quot;     
##  [5792] &quot;with the appearance of composure, till she might speak to him with more&quot;     
##  [5793] &quot;privacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued&quot;             
##  [5794] &quot;incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings,&quot;       
##  [5795] &quot;by exclamations of wretchedness.  In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby&quot;     
##  [5796] &quot;quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne&quot;       
##  [5797] &quot;that he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that&quot;     
##  [5798] &quot;evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm.  She instantly begged&quot;      
##  [5799] &quot;her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home, as she was&quot;       
##  [5800] &quot;too miserable to stay a minute longer.&quot;                                      
##  [5801] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5802] &quot;Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed&quot;         
##  [5803] &quot;that Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her&quot;      
##  [5804] &quot;wish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, they&quot;             
##  [5805] &quot;departed as soon the carriage could be found.  Scarcely a word was&quot;          
##  [5806] &quot;spoken during their return to Berkeley Street.  Marianne was in a&quot;           
##  [5807] &quot;silent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings&quot;       
##  [5808] &quot;was luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room,&quot;        
##  [5809] &quot;where hartshorn restored her a little to herself.  She was soon&quot;             
##  [5810] &quot;undressed and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, her&quot;        
##  [5811] &quot;sister then left her, and while she waited the return of Mrs. Jennings,&quot;     
##  [5812] &quot;had leisure enough for thinking over the past.&quot;                              
##  [5813] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5814] &quot;That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and&quot;           
##  [5815] &quot;Marianne she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it,&quot;          
##  [5816] &quot;seemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her own&quot;         
##  [5817] &quot;wishes, SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or&quot;                
##  [5818] &quot;misapprehension of any kind.  Nothing but a thorough change of&quot;              
##  [5819] &quot;sentiment could account for it.  Her indignation would have been still&quot;      
##  [5820] &quot;stronger than it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment which&quot;        
##  [5821] &quot;seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented&quot;        
##  [5822] &quot;her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with&quot;        
##  [5823] &quot;the affections of her sister from the first, without any design that&quot;        
##  [5824] &quot;would bear investigation.  Absence might have weakened his regard, and&quot;      
##  [5825] &quot;convenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such a&quot;       
##  [5826] &quot;regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt.&quot;           
##  [5827] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5828] &quot;As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already&quot;       
##  [5829] &quot;have given her, and on those still more severe which might await her in&quot;     
##  [5830] &quot;its probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepest&quot;         
##  [5831] &quot;concern.  Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she&quot;         
##  [5832] &quot;could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided in&quot;       
##  [5833] &quot;future, her mind might be always supported.  But every circumstance&quot;         
##  [5834] &quot;that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery&quot;      
##  [5835] &quot;of Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate and&quot;      
##  [5836] &quot;irreconcilable rupture with him.&quot;                                            
##  [5837] &quot;&quot;

##  [5843] &quot;Before the house-maid had lit their fire the next day, or the sun&quot;           
##  [5844] &quot;gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne, only&quot;     
##  [5845] &quot;half dressed, was kneeling against one of the window-seats for the sake&quot;     
##  [5846] &quot;of all the little light she could command from it, and writing as fast&quot;      
##  [5847] &quot;as a continual flow of tears would permit her.  In this situation,&quot;          
##  [5848] &quot;Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, first perceived&quot;        
##  [5849] &quot;her; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety,&quot;         
##  [5850] &quot;said, in a tone of the most considerate gentleness,&quot;                         
##  [5851] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5852] &quot;\&quot;Marianne, may I ask-?\&quot;&quot;                                                   
##  [5853] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5854] &quot;\&quot;No, Elinor,\&quot; she replied, \&quot;ask nothing; you will soon know all.\&quot;&quot;       
##  [5855] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5856] &quot;The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted no&quot;          
##  [5857] &quot;longer than while she spoke, and was immediately followed by a return&quot;       
##  [5858] &quot;of the same excessive affliction.  It was some minutes before she could&quot;     
##  [5859] &quot;go on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which still&quot;         
##  [5860] &quot;obliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of&quot;       
##  [5861] &quot;her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the&quot;      
##  [5862] &quot;last time to Willoughby.&quot;                                                    
##  [5863] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5864] &quot;Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power; and&quot;     
##  [5865] &quot;she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more, had not&quot;       
##  [5866] &quot;Marianne entreated her, with all the eagerness of the most nervous&quot;          
##  [5867] &quot;irritability, not to speak to her for the world.  In such&quot;                   
##  [5868] &quot;circumstances, it was better for both that they should not be long&quot;          
##  [5869] &quot;together; and the restless state of Marianne&#39;s mind not only prevented&quot;      
##  [5870] &quot;her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed, but&quot;          
##  [5871] &quot;requiring at once solitude and continual change of place, made her&quot;          
##  [5872] &quot;wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding the sight of every&quot;     
##  [5873] &quot;body.&quot;                                                                       
##  [5874] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5875] &quot;At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; and&quot;           
##  [5876] &quot;Elinor&#39;s attention was then all employed, not in urging her, not in&quot;         
##  [5877] &quot;pitying her, nor in appearing to regard her, but in endeavouring to&quot;         
##  [5878] &quot;engage Mrs. Jennings&#39;s notice entirely to herself.&quot;                          
##  [5879] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5880] &quot;As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a&quot;                
##  [5881] &quot;considerable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it,&quot;         
##  [5882] &quot;round the common working table, when a letter was delivered to&quot;              
##  [5883] &quot;Marianne, which she eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of a&quot;      
##  [5884] &quot;death-like paleness, instantly ran out of the room.  Elinor, who saw as&quot;     
##  [5885] &quot;plainly by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must come&quot;        
##  [5886] &quot;from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her&quot;      
##  [5887] &quot;hardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremour as&quot;       
##  [5888] &quot;made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings&#39;s notice.  That good&quot;    
##  [5889] &quot;lady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from&quot;            
##  [5890] &quot;Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which she&quot;           
##  [5891] &quot;treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it to&quot;     
##  [5892] &quot;her liking.  Of Elinor&#39;s distress, she was too busily employed in&quot;           
##  [5893] &quot;measuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; and&quot;      
##  [5894] &quot;calmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said,&quot;      
##  [5895] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5896] &quot;\&quot;Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my&quot;      
##  [5897] &quot;life!  MY girls were nothing to her, and yet they used to be foolish&quot;        
##  [5898] &quot;enough; but as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature.  I&quot;      
##  [5899] &quot;hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won&#39;t keep her waiting much&quot;           
##  [5900] &quot;longer, for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn.&quot;        
##  [5901] &quot;Pray, when are they to be married?\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [5902] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5903] &quot;Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment,&quot;            
##  [5904] &quot;obliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore,&quot;           
##  [5905] &quot;trying to smile, replied, \&quot;And have you really, Ma&#39;am, talked yourself&quot;     
##  [5906] &quot;into a persuasion of my sister&#39;s being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?  I&quot;        
##  [5907] &quot;thought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems to&quot;         
##  [5908] &quot;imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceive&quot;            
##  [5909] &quot;yourself any longer.  I do assure you that nothing would surprise me&quot;        
##  [5910] &quot;more than to hear of their being going to be married.\&quot;&quot;                     
##  [5911] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5912] &quot;\&quot;For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so?  Don&#39;t we&quot;       
##  [5913] &quot;all know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in&quot;      
##  [5914] &quot;love with each other from the first moment they met?  Did not I see&quot;         
##  [5915] &quot;them together in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I&quot;      
##  [5916] &quot;know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding&quot;        
##  [5917] &quot;clothes?  Come, come, this won&#39;t do.  Because you are so sly about it&quot;       
##  [5918] &quot;yourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no such&quot;           
##  [5919] &quot;thing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever so&quot;     
##  [5920] &quot;long.  I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte.\&quot;&quot;                     
##  [5921] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5922] &quot;\&quot;Indeed, Ma&#39;am,\&quot; said Elinor, very seriously, \&quot;you are mistaken.&quot;         
##  [5923] &quot;Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, and&quot;      
##  [5924] &quot;you will find that you have though you will not believe me now.\&quot;&quot;           
##  [5925] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5926] &quot;Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not spirits to say more,&quot;        
##  [5927] &quot;and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written, hurried&quot;        
##  [5928] &quot;away to their room, where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne&quot;            
##  [5929] &quot;stretched on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,&quot;       
##  [5930] &quot;and two or three others laying by her.  Elinor drew near, but without&quot;       
##  [5931] &quot;saying a word; and seating herself on the bed, took her hand, kissed&quot;        
##  [5932] &quot;her affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst of&quot;           
##  [5933] &quot;tears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne&#39;s. The&quot;        
##  [5934] &quot;latter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness of&quot;        
##  [5935] &quot;this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction, she&quot;     
##  [5936] &quot;put all the letters into Elinor&#39;s hands; and then covering her face&quot;         
##  [5937] &quot;with her handkerchief, almost screamed with agony.  Elinor, who knew&quot;        
##  [5938] &quot;that such grief, shocking as it was to witness it, must have its&quot;            
##  [5939] &quot;course, watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent&quot;     
##  [5940] &quot;itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby&#39;s letter, read as&quot;            
##  [5941] &quot;follows:&quot;                                                                    
##  [5942] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5943] &quot;                              \&quot;Bond Street, January.&quot;                       
##  [5944] &quot;     \&quot;MY DEAR MADAM,&quot;                                                       
##  [5945] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5946] &quot;     \&quot;I have just had the honour of receiving your&quot;                         
##  [5947] &quot;     letter, for which I beg to return my sincere&quot;                           
##  [5948] &quot;     acknowledgments.  I am much concerned to find there&quot;                    
##  [5949] &quot;     was anything in my behaviour last night that did&quot;                       
##  [5950] &quot;     not meet your approbation; and though I am quite at&quot;                    
##  [5951] &quot;     a loss to discover in what point I could be so&quot;                         
##  [5952] &quot;     unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your&quot;                           
##  [5953] &quot;     forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been&quot;                      
##  [5954] &quot;     perfectly unintentional.  I shall never reflect on&quot;                     
##  [5955] &quot;     my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire&quot;                  
##  [5956] &quot;     without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter&quot;                        
##  [5957] &quot;     myself it will not be broken by any mistake or&quot;                         
##  [5958] &quot;     misapprehension of my actions.  My esteem for your&quot;                     
##  [5959] &quot;     whole family is very sincere; but if I have been so&quot;                    
##  [5960] &quot;     unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than&quot;                   
##  [5961] &quot;     I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach myself&quot;                   
##  [5962] &quot;     for not having been more guarded in my professions&quot;                     
##  [5963] &quot;     of that esteem.  That I should ever have meant more&quot;                    
##  [5964] &quot;     you will allow to be impossible, when you understand&quot;                   
##  [5965] &quot;     that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere,&quot;                   
##  [5966] &quot;     and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before&quot;                       
##  [5967] &quot;     this engagement is fulfilled.  It is with great&quot;                        
##  [5968] &quot;     regret that I obey your commands in returning the&quot;                      
##  [5969] &quot;     letters with which I have been honoured from you,&quot;                      
##  [5970] &quot;     and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed&quot;                 
##  [5971] &quot;     on me.&quot;                                                                 
##  [5972] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5973] &quot;     \&quot;I am, dear Madam,&quot;                                                    
##  [5974] &quot;               \&quot;Your most obedient&quot;                                         
##  [5975] &quot;                    \&quot;humble servant,&quot;                                       
##  [5976] &quot;                                        \&quot;JOHN WILLOUGHBY.\&quot;&quot;                
##  [5977] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5978] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5979] &quot;With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss&quot;            
##  [5980] &quot;Dashwood, may be imagined.  Though aware, before she began it, that it&quot;      
##  [5981] &quot;must bring a confession of his inconstancy, and confirm their&quot;               
##  [5982] &quot;separation for ever, she was not aware that such language could be&quot;          
##  [5983] &quot;suffered to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable&quot;     
##  [5984] &quot;of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and&quot;             
##  [5985] &quot;delicate feeling--so far from the common decorum of a gentleman, as to&quot;      
##  [5986] &quot;send a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of bringing&quot;      
##  [5987] &quot;with his desire of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no&quot;     
##  [5988] &quot;breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever--a letter of&quot;        
##  [5989] &quot;which every line was an insult, and which proclaimed its writer to be&quot;       
##  [5990] &quot;deep in hardened villainy.&quot;                                                  
##  [5991] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [5992] &quot;She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment; then read&quot;     
##  [5993] &quot;it again and again; but every perusal only served to increase her&quot;           
##  [5994] &quot;abhorrence of the man, and so bitter were her feelings against him,&quot;         
##  [5995] &quot;that she dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound&quot;             
##  [5996] &quot;Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement, not as a loss to&quot;     
##  [5997] &quot;her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most&quot;           
##  [5998] &quot;irremediable of all evils, a connection, for life, with an unprincipled&quot;     
##  [5999] &quot;man, as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important.&quot;         
##  [6000] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6001] &quot;In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on the&quot;            
##  [6002] &quot;depravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on the&quot;         
##  [6003] &quot;very different mind of a very different person, who had no other&quot;            
##  [6004] &quot;connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with&quot;       
##  [6005] &quot;every thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her&quot;        
##  [6006] &quot;sister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread, and so&quot;     
##  [6007] &quot;entirely forgot how long she had been in the room, that when on hearing&quot;     
##  [6008] &quot;a carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see who&quot;          
##  [6009] &quot;could be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to&quot;          
##  [6010] &quot;perceive Mrs. Jennings&#39;s chariot, which she knew had not been ordered&quot;       
##  [6011] &quot;till one.  Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of&quot;              
##  [6012] &quot;contributing, at present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuse&quot;           
##  [6013] &quot;herself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being&quot;        
##  [6014] &quot;indisposed.  Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for&quot;     
##  [6015] &quot;its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeing&quot;       
##  [6016] &quot;her safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she found attempting to rise&quot;       
##  [6017] &quot;from the bed, and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from&quot;         
##  [6018] &quot;falling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest&quot;       
##  [6019] &quot;and food; for it was many days since she had any appetite, and many&quot;         
##  [6020] &quot;nights since she had really slept; and now, when her mind was no longer&quot;     
##  [6021] &quot;supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this was&quot;         
##  [6022] &quot;felt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous&quot;           
##  [6023] &quot;faintness.  A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,&quot;        
##  [6024] &quot;made her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express some&quot;         
##  [6025] &quot;sense of her kindness, by saying,&quot;                                           
##  [6026] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6027] &quot;\&quot;Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make you!\&quot;&quot;                                    
##  [6028] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6029] &quot;\&quot;I only wish,\&quot; replied her sister, \&quot;there were any thing I COULD do,&quot;     
##  [6030] &quot;which might be of comfort to you.\&quot;&quot;                                         
##  [6031] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6032] &quot;This, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne,&quot;       
##  [6033] &quot;who could only exclaim, in the anguish of her heart, \&quot;Oh! Elinor, I am&quot;     
##  [6034] &quot;miserable, indeed,\&quot; before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.&quot;            
##  [6035] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6036] &quot;Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in&quot;          
##  [6037] &quot;silence.&quot;                                                                    
##  [6038] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6039] &quot;\&quot;Exert yourself, dear Marianne,\&quot; she cried, \&quot;if you would not kill&quot;       
##  [6040] &quot;yourself and all who love you.  Think of your mother; think of her&quot;          
##  [6041] &quot;misery while YOU suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself.\&quot;&quot;            
##  [6042] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6043] &quot;\&quot;I cannot, I cannot,\&quot; cried Marianne; \&quot;leave me, leave me, if I&quot;          
##  [6044] &quot;distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me!  but do not torture me so.&quot;      
##  [6045] &quot;Oh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of&quot;          
##  [6046] &quot;exertion!  Happy, happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what I&quot;           
##  [6047] &quot;suffer.\&quot;&quot;                                                                   
##  [6048] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6049] &quot;\&quot;Do you call ME happy, Marianne?  Ah! if you knew!--And can you believe&quot;    
##  [6050] &quot;me to be so, while I see you so wretched!\&quot;&quot;                                 
##  [6051] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6052] &quot;\&quot;Forgive me, forgive me,\&quot; throwing her arms round her sister&#39;s neck; \&quot;I&quot;  
##  [6053] &quot;know you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you&quot;             
##  [6054] &quot;are--you must be happy; Edward loves you--what, oh what, can do away&quot;        
##  [6055] &quot;such happiness as that?\&quot;&quot;                                                   
##  [6056] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6057] &quot;\&quot;Many, many circumstances,\&quot; said Elinor, solemnly.&quot;                        
##  [6058] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6059] &quot;\&quot;No, no, no,\&quot; cried Marianne wildly, \&quot;he loves you, and only you.  You&quot;   
##  [6060] &quot;CAN have no grief.\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##  [6061] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6062] &quot;\&quot;I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state.\&quot;&quot;                   
##  [6063] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6064] &quot;\&quot;And you will never see me otherwise.  Mine is a misery which nothing&quot;      
##  [6065] &quot;can do away.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [6066] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6067] &quot;\&quot;You must not talk so, Marianne.  Have you no comforts? no friends?  Is&quot;    
##  [6068] &quot;your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation?  Much as you&quot;           
##  [6069] &quot;suffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of&quot;       
##  [6070] &quot;his character had been delayed to a later period--if your engagement&quot;        
##  [6071] &quot;had been carried on for months and months, as it might have been,&quot;           
##  [6072] &quot;before he chose to put an end to it.  Every additional day of unhappy&quot;       
##  [6073] &quot;confidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful.\&quot;&quot;         
##  [6074] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6075] &quot;\&quot;Engagement!\&quot; cried Marianne, \&quot;there has been no engagement.\&quot;&quot;           
##  [6076] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6077] &quot;\&quot;No engagement!\&quot;&quot;                                                          
##  [6078] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6079] &quot;\&quot;No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him.  He has broken no faith&quot;     
##  [6080] &quot;with me.\&quot;&quot;                                                                  
##  [6081] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6082] &quot;\&quot;But he told you that he loved you.\&quot;&quot;                                      
##  [6083] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6084] &quot;\&quot;Yes--no--never absolutely.  It was every day implied, but never&quot;           
##  [6085] &quot;professedly declared.  Sometimes I thought it had been--but it never&quot;        
##  [6086] &quot;was.\&quot;&quot;                                                                      
##  [6087] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6088] &quot;\&quot;Yet you wrote to him?\&quot;--&quot;                                                 
##  [6089] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6090] &quot;\&quot;Yes--could that be wrong after all that had passed?-- But I cannot&quot;        
##  [6091] &quot;talk.\&quot;&quot;                                                                     
##  [6092] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6093] &quot;Elinor said no more, and turning again to the three letters which now&quot;       
##  [6094] &quot;raised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over the&quot;         
##  [6095] &quot;contents of all.  The first, which was what her sister had sent him on&quot;      
##  [6096] &quot;their arrival in town, was to this effect.&quot;                                  
##  [6097] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6098] &quot;                         Berkeley Street, January.&quot;                          
##  [6099] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6100] &quot;     \&quot;How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on&quot;                            
##  [6101] &quot;     receiving this; and I think you will feel something&quot;                    
##  [6102] &quot;     more than surprise, when you know that I am in town.&quot;                   
##  [6103] &quot;     An opportunity of coming hither, though with Mrs.&quot;                      
##  [6104] &quot;     Jennings, was a temptation we could not resist.&quot;                        
##  [6105] &quot;     I wish you may receive this in time to come here&quot;                       
##  [6106] &quot;     to-night, but I will not depend on it.  At any rate&quot;                    
##  [6107] &quot;     I shall expect you to-morrow. For the present, adieu.&quot;                  
##  [6108] &quot;&quot;

##  [6111] &quot;Her second note, which had been written on the morning after the dance&quot;      
##  [6112] &quot;at the Middletons&#39;, was in these words:--&quot;                                   
##  [6113] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6114] &quot;     \&quot;I cannot express my disappointment in having&quot;                         
##  [6115] &quot;     missed you the day before yesterday, nor my astonishment&quot;               
##  [6116] &quot;     at not having received any answer to a note which&quot;                      
##  [6117] &quot;     I sent you above a week ago.  I have been expecting&quot;                    
##  [6118] &quot;     to hear from you, and still more to see you, every&quot;                     
##  [6119] &quot;     hour of the day.  Pray call again as soon as possible,&quot;                 
##  [6120] &quot;     and explain the reason of my having expected this&quot;                      
##  [6121] &quot;     in vain.  You had better come earlier another time,&quot;                    
##  [6122] &quot;     because we are generally out by one.  We were last&quot;                     
##  [6123] &quot;     night at Lady Middleton&#39;s, where there was a dance.&quot;                    
##  [6124] &quot;     I have been told that you were asked to be of the&quot;                      
##  [6125] &quot;     party.  But could it be so?  You must be very much&quot;                     
##  [6126] &quot;     altered indeed since we parted, if that could be&quot;                       
##  [6127] &quot;     the case, and you not there.  But I will not suppose&quot;                   
##  [6128] &quot;     this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your&quot;                    
##  [6129] &quot;     personal assurance of its being otherwise.&quot;                             
##  [6130] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6131] &quot;                                            \&quot;M.D.\&quot;&quot;                        
##  [6132] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6133] &quot;The contents of her last note to him were these:--&quot;                          
##  [6134] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6135] &quot;     \&quot;What am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your&quot;                            
##  [6136] &quot;     behaviour last night?  Again I demand an explanation&quot;                   
##  [6137] &quot;     of it.  I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure&quot;                   
##  [6138] &quot;     which our separation naturally produced, with the&quot;                      
##  [6139] &quot;     familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared&quot;                      
##  [6140] &quot;     to me to justify.  I was repulsed indeed! I have&quot;                       
##  [6141] &quot;     passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse&quot;                      
##  [6142] &quot;     a conduct which can scarcely be called less than&quot;                       
##  [6143] &quot;     insulting; but though I have not yet been able to&quot;                      
##  [6144] &quot;     form any reasonable apology for your behaviour,&quot;                        
##  [6145] &quot;     I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of&quot;                     
##  [6146] &quot;     it.  You have perhaps been misinformed, or purposely&quot;                   
##  [6147] &quot;     deceived, in something concerning me, which may have&quot;                   
##  [6148] &quot;     lowered me in your opinion.  Tell me what it is,&quot;                       
##  [6149] &quot;     explain the grounds on which you acted, and I shall&quot;                    
##  [6150] &quot;     be satisfied, in being able to satisfy you.  It&quot;                        
##  [6151] &quot;     would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill&quot;                      
##  [6152] &quot;     of you; but if I am to do it, if I am to learn that&quot;                    
##  [6153] &quot;     you are not what we have hitherto believed you, that&quot;                   
##  [6154] &quot;     your regard for us all was insincere, that your&quot;                        
##  [6155] &quot;     behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let&quot;                      
##  [6156] &quot;     it be told as soon as possible.  My feelings are at&quot;                    
##  [6157] &quot;     present in a state of dreadful indecision; I wish&quot;                      
##  [6158] &quot;     to acquit you, but certainty on either side will be&quot;                    
##  [6159] &quot;     ease to what I now suffer.  If your sentiments are&quot;                     
##  [6160] &quot;     no longer what they were, you will return my notes,&quot;                    
##  [6161] &quot;     and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.&quot;                   
##  [6162] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6163] &quot;                                             \&quot;M.D.\&quot;&quot;                       
##  [6164] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6165] &quot;That such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have been&quot;     
##  [6166] &quot;so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby&#39;s sake, would have been unwilling&quot;       
##  [6167] &quot;to believe.  But her condemnation of him did not blind her to the&quot;           
##  [6168] &quot;impropriety of their having been written at all; and she was silently&quot;       
##  [6169] &quot;grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs&quot;     
##  [6170] &quot;of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding, and most severely&quot;       
##  [6171] &quot;condemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving that she had finished&quot;     
##  [6172] &quot;the letters, observed to her that they contained nothing but what any&quot;       
##  [6173] &quot;one would have written in the same situation.&quot;                               
##  [6174] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6175] &quot;\&quot;I felt myself,\&quot; she added, \&quot;to be as solemnly engaged to him, as if&quot;     
##  [6176] &quot;the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other.\&quot;&quot;                  
##  [6177] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6178] &quot;\&quot;I can believe it,\&quot; said Elinor; \&quot;but unfortunately he did not feel the&quot;  
##  [6179] &quot;same.\&quot;&quot;                                                                     
##  [6180] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6181] &quot;\&quot;He DID feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and weeks he felt it.  I know&quot;     
##  [6182] &quot;he did.  Whatever may have changed him now, (and nothing but the&quot;            
##  [6183] &quot;blackest art employed against me can have done it), I was once as dear&quot;      
##  [6184] &quot;to him as my own soul could wish.  This lock of hair, which now he can&quot;      
##  [6185] &quot;so readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest&quot;                  
##  [6186] &quot;supplication.  Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his&quot;         
##  [6187] &quot;voice at that moment!  Have you forgot the last evening of our being&quot;        
##  [6188] &quot;together at Barton?  The morning that we parted too!  When he told me&quot;       
##  [6189] &quot;that it might be many weeks before we met again--his distress--can I&quot;        
##  [6190] &quot;ever forget his distress?\&quot;&quot;                                                 
##  [6191] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6192] &quot;For a moment or two she could say no more; but when this emotion had&quot;        
##  [6193] &quot;passed away, she added, in a firmer tone,&quot;                                   
##  [6194] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6195] &quot;\&quot;Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.\&quot;&quot;                
##  [6196] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6197] &quot;\&quot;Dearest Marianne, who but himself?  By whom can he have been&quot;              
##  [6198] &quot;instigated?\&quot;&quot;                                                               
##  [6199] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6200] &quot;\&quot;By all the world, rather than by his own heart.  I could rather&quot;           
##  [6201] &quot;believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me&quot;       
##  [6202] &quot;in his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty.  This&quot;      
##  [6203] &quot;woman of whom he writes--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but your&quot;     
##  [6204] &quot;own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to bely me.&quot;     
##  [6205] &quot;Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I would not&quot;         
##  [6206] &quot;rather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?\&quot;&quot;       
##  [6207] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6208] &quot;Elinor would not contend, and only replied, \&quot;Whoever may have been so&quot;      
##  [6209] &quot;detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph,&quot;      
##  [6210] &quot;my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own&quot;           
##  [6211] &quot;innocence and good intentions supports your spirits.  It is a&quot;               
##  [6212] &quot;reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence.\&quot;&quot;             
##  [6213] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6214] &quot;\&quot;No, no,\&quot; cried Marianne, \&quot;misery such as mine has no pride.  I care&quot;     
##  [6215] &quot;not who knows that I am wretched.  The triumph of seeing me so may be&quot;       
##  [6216] &quot;open to all the world.  Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be&quot;       
##  [6217] &quot;proud and independent as they like--may resist insult, or return&quot;            
##  [6218] &quot;mortification--but I cannot.  I must feel--I must be wretched--and they&quot;     
##  [6219] &quot;are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can.\&quot;&quot;                    
##  [6220] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6221] &quot;\&quot;But for my mother&#39;s sake and mine--\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [6222] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6223] &quot;\&quot;I would do more than for my own.  But to appear happy when I am so&quot;        
##  [6224] &quot;miserable--Oh! who can require it?\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [6225] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6226] &quot;Again they were both silent.  Elinor was employed in walking&quot;                
##  [6227] &quot;thoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire,&quot;      
##  [6228] &quot;without knowing that she received warmth from one, or discerning&quot;            
##  [6229] &quot;objects through the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,&quot;     
##  [6230] &quot;with her head leaning against one of its posts, again took up&quot;               
##  [6231] &quot;Willoughby&#39;s letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence,&quot;             
##  [6232] &quot;exclaimed--&quot;                                                                 
##  [6233] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6234] &quot;\&quot;It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours!&quot;          
##  [6235] &quot;Cruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you.  Elinor, nothing can.  Whatever&quot;       
##  [6236] &quot;he might have heard against me--ought he not to have suspended his&quot;          
##  [6237] &quot;belief? ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the power&quot;      
##  [6238] &quot;of clearing myself? &#39;The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)&quot;      
##  [6239] &quot;which you so obligingly bestowed on me&#39;--That is unpardonable.&quot;              
##  [6240] &quot;Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?  Oh,&quot;           
##  [6241] &quot;barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?\&quot;&quot;                       
##  [6242] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6243] &quot;\&quot;No, Marianne, in no possible way.\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [6244] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6245] &quot;\&quot;And yet this woman--who knows what her art may have been?--how long it&quot;    
##  [6246] &quot;may have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her!--Who is&quot;        
##  [6247] &quot;she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and&quot;        
##  [6248] &quot;attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! no one, no one--he&quot;           
##  [6249] &quot;talked to me only of myself.\&quot;&quot;                                              
##  [6250] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6251] &quot;Another pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended thus.&quot;     
##  [6252] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6253] &quot;\&quot;Elinor, I must go home.  I must go and comfort mama.  Can not we be&quot;       
##  [6254] &quot;gone to-morrow?\&quot;&quot;                                                           
##  [6255] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6256] &quot;\&quot;To-morrow, Marianne!\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [6257] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6258] &quot;\&quot;Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for Willoughby&#39;s sake--and&quot;       
##  [6259] &quot;now who cares for me? Who regards me?\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [6260] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6261] &quot;\&quot;It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much more&quot;    
##  [6262] &quot;than civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a&quot;       
##  [6263] &quot;hasty removal as that.\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [6264] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6265] &quot;\&quot;Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot stay here long, I&quot;    
##  [6266] &quot;cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people.&quot;        
##  [6267] &quot;The Middletons and Palmers--how am I to bear their pity?  The pity of&quot;       
##  [6268] &quot;such a woman as Lady Middleton!  Oh, what would HE say to that!\&quot;&quot;           
##  [6269] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6270] &quot;Elinor advised her to lie down again, and for a moment she did so; but&quot;      
##  [6271] &quot;no attitude could give her ease; and in restless pain of mind and body&quot;      
##  [6272] &quot;she moved from one posture to another, till growing more and more&quot;           
##  [6273] &quot;hysterical, her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at&quot;         
##  [6274] &quot;all, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for&quot;         
##  [6275] &quot;assistance.  Some lavender drops, however, which she was at length&quot;          
##  [6276] &quot;persuaded to take, were of use; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings&quot;       
##  [6277] &quot;returned, she continued on the bed quiet and motionless.&quot;                    
##  [6278] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6279] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6280] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6281] &quot;CHAPTER 30&quot;                                                                  
##  [6282] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6283] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6284] &quot;Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return, and without&quot;     
##  [6285] &quot;waiting to have her request of admittance answered, opened the door and&quot;     
##  [6286] &quot;walked in with a look of real concern.&quot;                                      
##  [6287] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6288] &quot;\&quot;How do you do my dear?\&quot;--said she in a voice of great compassion to&quot;      
##  [6289] &quot;Marianne, who turned away her face without attempting to answer.&quot;            
##  [6290] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6291] &quot;\&quot;How is she, Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing! she looks very bad.-- No&quot;          
##  [6292] &quot;wonder.  Ay, it is but too true.  He is to be married very soon--a&quot;          
##  [6293] &quot;good-for-nothing fellow!  I have no patience with him.  Mrs. Taylor&quot;         
##  [6294] &quot;told me of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particular&quot;         
##  [6295] &quot;friend of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed&quot;      
##  [6296] &quot;it; and I was almost ready to sink as it was.  Well, said I, all I can&quot;      
##  [6297] &quot;say is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my&quot;                
##  [6298] &quot;acquaintance abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife may&quot;       
##  [6299] &quot;plague his heart out.  And so I shall always say, my dear, you may&quot;          
##  [6300] &quot;depend on it.  I have no notion of men&#39;s going on in this way; and if&quot;       
##  [6301] &quot;ever I meet him again, I will give him such a dressing as he has not&quot;        
##  [6302] &quot;had this many a day.  But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne;&quot;      
##  [6303] &quot;he is not the only young man in the world worth having; and with your&quot;       
##  [6304] &quot;pretty face you will never want admirers.  Well, poor thing!  I won&#39;t&quot;       
##  [6305] &quot;disturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry out at once and&quot;     
##  [6306] &quot;have done with.  The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight&quot;       
##  [6307] &quot;you know, and that will amuse her.\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [6308] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6309] &quot;She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she&quot;            
##  [6310] &quot;supposed her young friend&#39;s affliction could be increased by noise.&quot;         
##  [6311] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6312] &quot;Marianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with&quot;          
##  [6313] &quot;them.  Elinor even advised her against it.  But \&quot;no, she would go down;&quot;    
##  [6314] &quot;she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less.\&quot;&quot;      
##  [6315] &quot;Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive,&quot;         
##  [6316] &quot;though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner,&quot;      
##  [6317] &quot;said no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,&quot;         
##  [6318] &quot;while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her into&quot;      
##  [6319] &quot;the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.&quot;                        
##  [6320] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6321] &quot;When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was calmer&quot;     
##  [6322] &quot;than her sister had expected.  Had she tried to speak, or had she been&quot;      
##  [6323] &quot;conscious of half Mrs. Jennings&#39;s well-meant but ill-judged attentions&quot;      
##  [6324] &quot;to her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but not a&quot;             
##  [6325] &quot;syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughts&quot;              
##  [6326] &quot;preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her.&quot;      
##  [6327] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6328] &quot;Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings&#39;s kindness, though its&quot;             
##  [6329] &quot;effusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous, made&quot;     
##  [6330] &quot;her those acknowledgments, and returned her those civilities, which her&quot;     
##  [6331] &quot;sister could not make or return for herself.  Their good friend saw&quot;         
##  [6332] &quot;that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was due to her&quot;         
##  [6333] &quot;which might make her at all less so.  She treated her therefore, with&quot;       
##  [6334] &quot;all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the&quot;     
##  [6335] &quot;last day of its holidays.  Marianne was to have the best place by the&quot;       
##  [6336] &quot;fire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and to&quot;       
##  [6337] &quot;be amused by the relation of all the news of the day.  Had not Elinor,&quot;      
##  [6338] &quot;in the sad countenance of her sister, seen a check to all mirth, she&quot;        
##  [6339] &quot;could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings&#39;s endeavours to cure a&quot;         
##  [6340] &quot;disappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a&quot;        
##  [6341] &quot;good fire.  As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was&quot;          
##  [6342] &quot;forced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could stay no longer.&quot;       
##  [6343] &quot;With a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her sister not to&quot;         
##  [6344] &quot;follow her, she directly got up and hurried out of the room.&quot;                
##  [6345] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6346] &quot;\&quot;Poor soul!\&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone, \&quot;how it&quot;       
##  [6347] &quot;grieves me to see her!  And I declare if she is not gone away without&quot;       
##  [6348] &quot;finishing her wine!  And the dried cherries too!  Lord! nothing seems&quot;       
##  [6349] &quot;to do her any good.  I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I&quot;     
##  [6350] &quot;would send all over the town for it.  Well, it is the oddest thing to&quot;       
##  [6351] &quot;me, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill!  But when there is&quot;     
##  [6352] &quot;plenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord bless&quot;      
##  [6353] &quot;you! they care no more about such things!--\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [6354] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6355] &quot;\&quot;The lady then--Miss Grey I think you called her--is very rich?\&quot;&quot;          
##  [6356] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6357] &quot;\&quot;Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.  Did you ever see her? a smart,&quot;           
##  [6358] &quot;stylish girl they say, but not handsome.  I remember her aunt very&quot;          
##  [6359] &quot;well, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man.  But the family&quot;       
##  [6360] &quot;are all rich together.  Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it&quot;      
##  [6361] &quot;won&#39;t come before it&#39;s wanted; for they say he is all to pieces.  No&quot;        
##  [6362] &quot;wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters!  Well, it don&#39;t&quot;        
##  [6363] &quot;signify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makes&quot;      
##  [6364] &quot;love to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to fly&quot;     
##  [6365] &quot;off from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl is&quot;          
##  [6366] &quot;ready to have him.  Why don&#39;t he, in such a case, sell his horses, let&quot;      
##  [6367] &quot;his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once? I&quot;     
##  [6368] &quot;warrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters&quot;       
##  [6369] &quot;came round.  But that won&#39;t do now-a-days; nothing in the way of&quot;            
##  [6370] &quot;pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age.\&quot;&quot;               
##  [6371] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6372] &quot;\&quot;Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is?  Is she said to be&quot;          
##  [6373] &quot;amiable?\&quot;&quot;                                                                  
##  [6374] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6375] &quot;\&quot;I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard her&quot;             
##  [6376] &quot;mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day&quot;       
##  [6377] &quot;Miss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would&quot;     
##  [6378] &quot;not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison could&quot;      
##  [6379] &quot;never agree.\&quot;--&quot;                                                            
##  [6380] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6381] &quot;\&quot;And who are the Ellisons?\&quot;&quot;                                               
##  [6382] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6383] &quot;\&quot;Her guardians, my dear.  But now she is of age and may choose for&quot;         
##  [6384] &quot;herself; and a pretty choice she has made!--What now,\&quot; after pausing a&quot;     
##  [6385] &quot;moment--\&quot;your poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan&quot;      
##  [6386] &quot;by herself.  Is there nothing one can get to comfort her?  Poor dear,&quot;       
##  [6387] &quot;it seems quite cruel to let her be alone.  Well, by-and-by we shall&quot;         
##  [6388] &quot;have a few friends, and that will amuse her a little.  What shall we&quot;        
##  [6389] &quot;play at?  She hates whist I know; but is there no round game she cares&quot;      
##  [6390] &quot;for?\&quot;&quot;                                                                      
##  [6391] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6392] &quot;\&quot;Dear ma&#39;am, this kindness is quite unnecessary.  Marianne, I dare say,&quot;    
##  [6393] &quot;will not leave her room again this evening.  I shall persuade her if I&quot;      
##  [6394] &quot;can to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest.\&quot;&quot;                     
##  [6395] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6396] &quot;\&quot;Aye, I believe that will be best for her.  Let her name her own&quot;           
##  [6397] &quot;supper, and go to bed.  Lord! no wonder she has been looking so bad and&quot;     
##  [6398] &quot;so cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been&quot;      
##  [6399] &quot;hanging over her head as long as that.  And so the letter that came&quot;         
##  [6400] &quot;today finished it!  Poor soul!  I am sure if I had had a notion of it,&quot;      
##  [6401] &quot;I would not have joked her about it for all my money.  But then you&quot;         
##  [6402] &quot;know, how should I guess such a thing?  I made sure of its being&quot;            
##  [6403] &quot;nothing but a common love letter, and you know young people like to be&quot;      
##  [6404] &quot;laughed at about them.  Lord!  how concerned Sir John and my daughters&quot;      
##  [6405] &quot;will be when they hear it!  If I had my senses about me I might have&quot;        
##  [6406] &quot;called in Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it.  But I&quot;        
##  [6407] &quot;shall see them tomorrow.\&quot;&quot;                                                  
##  [6408] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6409] &quot;\&quot;It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and&quot;     
##  [6410] &quot;Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest&quot;        
##  [6411] &quot;allusion to what has passed, before my sister.  Their own good-nature&quot;       
##  [6412] &quot;must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing&quot;      
##  [6413] &quot;about it when she is present; and the less that may ever be said to&quot;         
##  [6414] &quot;myself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my&quot;       
##  [6415] &quot;dear madam will easily believe.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [6416] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6417] &quot;\&quot;Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed.  It must be terrible for you to hear&quot;     
##  [6418] &quot;it talked of; and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention a&quot;       
##  [6419] &quot;word about it to her for the world.  You saw I did not all dinner time.&quot;     
##  [6420] &quot;No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very&quot;             
##  [6421] &quot;thoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint, as I&quot;          
##  [6422] &quot;certainly will.  For my part, I think the less that is said about such&quot;      
##  [6423] &quot;things, the better, the sooner &#39;tis blown over and forgot.  And what&quot;        
##  [6424] &quot;does talking ever do you know?\&quot;&quot;                                            
##  [6425] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6426] &quot;\&quot;In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many cases&quot;    
##  [6427] &quot;of a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances which, for&quot;     
##  [6428] &quot;the sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become the&quot;          
##  [6429] &quot;public conversation.  I must do THIS justice to Mr. Willoughby--he has&quot;      
##  [6430] &quot;broken no positive engagement with my sister.\&quot;&quot;                             
##  [6431] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6432] &quot;\&quot;Law, my dear!  Don&#39;t pretend to defend him.  No positive engagement&quot;       
##  [6433] &quot;indeed! after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the&quot;         
##  [6434] &quot;very rooms they were to live in hereafter!\&quot;&quot;                                
##  [6435] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6436] &quot;Elinor, for her sister&#39;s sake, could not press the subject farther, and&quot;     
##  [6437] &quot;she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby&#39;s; since, though&quot;        
##  [6438] &quot;Marianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the enforcement&quot;      
##  [6439] &quot;of the real truth.  After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,&quot;     
##  [6440] &quot;with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.&quot;                           
##  [6441] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6442] &quot;\&quot;Well, my dear, &#39;tis a true saying about an ill-wind, for it will be&quot;       
##  [6443] &quot;all the better for Colonel Brandon.  He will have her at last; aye,&quot;         
##  [6444] &quot;that he will.  Mind me, now, if they an&#39;t married by Mid-summer.  Lord!&quot;     
##  [6445] &quot;how he&#39;ll chuckle over this news!  I hope he will come tonight.  It&quot;         
##  [6446] &quot;will be all to one a better match for your sister.  Two thousand a year&quot;     
##  [6447] &quot;without debt or drawback--except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I&quot;      
##  [6448] &quot;had forgot her; but she may be &#39;prenticed out at a small cost, and then&quot;     
##  [6449] &quot;what does it signify?  Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you;&quot;            
##  [6450] &quot;exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and&quot;        
##  [6451] &quot;conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered&quot;        
##  [6452] &quot;with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in&quot;       
##  [6453] &quot;one corner!  Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were&quot;      
##  [6454] &quot;there!  Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a&quot;       
##  [6455] &quot;very pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for;&quot;      
##  [6456] &quot;and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile&quot;      
##  [6457] &quot;from the turnpike-road, so &#39;tis never dull, for if you only go and sit&quot;      
##  [6458] &quot;up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriages&quot;     
##  [6459] &quot;that pass along.  Oh! &#39;tis a nice place!  A butcher hard by in the&quot;          
##  [6460] &quot;village, and the parsonage-house within a stone&#39;s throw.  To my fancy,&quot;      
##  [6461] &quot;a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to&quot;        
##  [6462] &quot;send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than&quot;       
##  [6463] &quot;your mother.  Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can.&quot;         
##  [6464] &quot;One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down.  If we CAN but&quot;       
##  [6465] &quot;put Willoughby out of her head!\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [6466] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6467] &quot;\&quot;Ay, if we can do THAT, Ma&#39;am,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;we shall do very well&quot;      
##  [6468] &quot;with or without Colonel Brandon.\&quot; And then rising, she went away to&quot;        
##  [6469] &quot;join Marianne, whom she found, as she expected, in her own room,&quot;            
##  [6470] &quot;leaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which,&quot;         
##  [6471] &quot;till Elinor&#39;s entrance, had been her only light.&quot;                            
##  [6472] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6473] &quot;\&quot;You had better leave me,\&quot; was all the notice that her sister received&quot;    
##  [6474] &quot;from her.&quot;                                                                   
##  [6475] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6476] &quot;\&quot;I will leave you,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;if you will go to bed.\&quot; But this,&quot;     
##  [6477] &quot;from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at first&quot;        
##  [6478] &quot;refused to do.  Her sister&#39;s earnest, though gentle persuasion,&quot;             
##  [6479] &quot;however, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay her&quot;        
##  [6480] &quot;aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some quiet&quot;     
##  [6481] &quot;rest before she left her.&quot;                                                   
##  [6482] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6483] &quot;In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined by&quot;      
##  [6484] &quot;Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand.&quot;           
##  [6485] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6486] &quot;\&quot;My dear,\&quot; said she, entering, \&quot;I have just recollected that I have&quot;      
##  [6487] &quot;some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was&quot;           
##  [6488] &quot;tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister.  My poor&quot;           
##  [6489] &quot;husband! how fond he was of it!  Whenever he had a touch of his old&quot;         
##  [6490] &quot;colicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the&quot;       
##  [6491] &quot;world.  Do take it to your sister.\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [6492] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6493] &quot;\&quot;Dear Ma&#39;am,\&quot; replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the&quot;            
##  [6494] &quot;complaints for which it was recommended, \&quot;how good you are!  But I have&quot;    
##  [6495] &quot;just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think&quot;       
##  [6496] &quot;nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me&quot;      
##  [6497] &quot;leave, I will drink the wine myself.\&quot;&quot;                                      
##  [6498] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6499] &quot;Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes&quot;         
##  [6500] &quot;earlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she&quot;              
##  [6501] &quot;swallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a&quot;          
##  [6502] &quot;colicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its healing&quot;     
##  [6503] &quot;powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself&quot;     
##  [6504] &quot;as on her sister.&quot;                                                           
##  [6505] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6506] &quot;Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his manner&quot;      
##  [6507] &quot;of looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied that&quot;     
##  [6508] &quot;he neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he&quot;     
##  [6509] &quot;was already aware of what occasioned her absence.  Mrs. Jennings was&quot;        
##  [6510] &quot;not struck by the same thought; for soon after his entrance, she walked&quot;     
##  [6511] &quot;across the room to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered--&quot;     
##  [6512] &quot;\&quot;The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.  He knows nothing of it;&quot;      
##  [6513] &quot;do tell him, my dear.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##  [6514] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6515] &quot;He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers, and, with a look&quot;          
##  [6516] &quot;which perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after her&quot;     
##  [6517] &quot;sister.&quot;                                                                     
##  [6518] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6519] &quot;\&quot;Marianne is not well,\&quot; said she.  \&quot;She has been indisposed all day,&quot;     
##  [6520] &quot;and we have persuaded her to go to bed.\&quot;&quot;                                   
##  [6521] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6522] &quot;\&quot;Perhaps, then,\&quot; he hesitatingly replied, \&quot;what I heard this morning&quot;     
##  [6523] &quot;may be--there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at&quot;      
##  [6524] &quot;first.\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
##  [6525] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6526] &quot;\&quot;What did you hear?\&quot;&quot;                                                      
##  [6527] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6528] &quot;\&quot;That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in short, that a man,&quot;       
##  [6529] &quot;whom I KNEW to be engaged--but how shall I tell you?  If you know it&quot;        
##  [6530] &quot;already, as surely you must, I may be spared.\&quot;&quot;                             
##  [6531] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6532] &quot;\&quot;You mean,\&quot; answered Elinor, with forced calmness, \&quot;Mr. Willoughby&#39;s&quot;     
##  [6533] &quot;marriage with Miss Grey.  Yes, we DO know it all.  This seems to have&quot;       
##  [6534] &quot;been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded&quot;     
##  [6535] &quot;it to us.  Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable!  Where did you hear it?\&quot;&quot;        
##  [6536] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6537] &quot;\&quot;In a stationer&#39;s shop in Pall Mall, where I had business.  Two ladies&quot;     
##  [6538] &quot;were waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other&quot;       
##  [6539] &quot;an account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting&quot;           
##  [6540] &quot;concealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all.  The name&quot;       
##  [6541] &quot;of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my&quot;        
##  [6542] &quot;attention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing&quot;      
##  [6543] &quot;was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was&quot;      
##  [6544] &quot;no longer to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,&quot;      
##  [6545] &quot;with many particulars of preparations and other matters.  One thing,&quot;        
##  [6546] &quot;especially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still&quot;         
##  [6547] &quot;more:--as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe&quot;           
##  [6548] &quot;Magna, his seat in Somersetshire.  My astonishment!--but it would be&quot;        
##  [6549] &quot;impossible to describe what I felt.  The communicative lady I learnt,&quot;       
##  [6550] &quot;on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs.&quot;        
##  [6551] &quot;Ellison, and that, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss&quot;       
##  [6552] &quot;Grey&#39;s guardian.\&quot;&quot;                                                          
##  [6553] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6554] &quot;\&quot;It is.  But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand&quot;     
##  [6555] &quot;pounds?  In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation.\&quot;&quot;            
##  [6556] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6557] &quot;\&quot;It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least I think\&quot;--he stopped&quot;   
##  [6558] &quot;a moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself, \&quot;And&quot;      
##  [6559] &quot;your sister--how did she--\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [6560] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6561] &quot;\&quot;Her sufferings have been very severe.  I have only to hope that they&quot;      
##  [6562] &quot;may be proportionately short.  It has been, it is a most cruel&quot;              
##  [6563] &quot;affliction.  Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard;&quot;       
##  [6564] &quot;and even now, perhaps--but I am almost convinced that he never was&quot;          
##  [6565] &quot;really attached to her.  He has been very deceitful! and, in some&quot;           
##  [6566] &quot;points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.\&quot;&quot;                        
##  [6567] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6568] &quot;\&quot;Ah!\&quot; said Colonel Brandon, \&quot;there is, indeed!  But your sister does&quot;     
##  [6569] &quot;not--I think you said so--she does not consider quite as you do?\&quot;&quot;          
##  [6570] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6571] &quot;\&quot;You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would still&quot;     
##  [6572] &quot;justify him if she could.\&quot;&quot;                                                 
##  [6573] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6574] &quot;He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of the&quot;               
##  [6575] &quot;tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject was&quot;        
##  [6576] &quot;necessarily dropped.  Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasure&quot;     
##  [6577] &quot;while they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of Miss&quot;         
##  [6578] &quot;Dashwood&#39;s communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel&quot;        
##  [6579] &quot;Brandon&#39;s side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of&quot;        
##  [6580] &quot;hope and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole evening&quot;       
##  [6581] &quot;more serious and thoughtful than usual.&quot;                                     
##  [6582] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6583] &quot;&quot;

##  [6585] &quot;CHAPTER 31&quot;

##  [6587] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6588] &quot;From a night of more sleep than she had expected, Marianne awoke the&quot;        
##  [6589] &quot;next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had&quot;           
##  [6590] &quot;closed her eyes.&quot;                                                            
##  [6591] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6592] &quot;Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt; and&quot;     
##  [6593] &quot;before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject again and&quot;     
##  [6594] &quot;again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on&quot;      
##  [6595] &quot;Elinor&#39;s side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on&quot;          
##  [6596] &quot;Marianne&#39;s, as before.  Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as&quot;     
##  [6597] &quot;unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at others, lost every&quot;           
##  [6598] &quot;consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him.  At one moment she&quot;      
##  [6599] &quot;was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world, at&quot;          
##  [6600] &quot;another she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third&quot;          
##  [6601] &quot;could resist it with energy.  In one thing, however, she was uniform,&quot;       
##  [6602] &quot;when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was possible, the&quot;          
##  [6603] &quot;presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence when obliged to&quot;      
##  [6604] &quot;endure it.  Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs.&quot;               
##  [6605] &quot;Jennings&#39;s entering into her sorrows with any compassion.&quot;                   
##  [6606] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6607] &quot;\&quot;No, no, no, it cannot be,\&quot; she cried; \&quot;she cannot feel.  Her kindness&quot;   
##  [6608] &quot;is not sympathy; her good-nature is not tenderness.  All that she wants&quot;     
##  [6609] &quot;is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.\&quot;&quot;                 
##  [6610] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6611] &quot;Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her&quot;      
##  [6612] &quot;sister was often led in her opinion of others, by the irritable&quot;             
##  [6613] &quot;refinement of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her&quot;      
##  [6614] &quot;on the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished&quot;     
##  [6615] &quot;manner.  Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there be&quot;        
##  [6616] &quot;that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities and an&quot;         
##  [6617] &quot;excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid.  She expected&quot;     
##  [6618] &quot;from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she&quot;        
##  [6619] &quot;judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on&quot;         
##  [6620] &quot;herself.  Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters were together&quot;     
##  [6621] &quot;in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart of Mrs.&quot;             
##  [6622] &quot;Jennings still lower in her estimation; because, through her own&quot;            
##  [6623] &quot;weakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself, though&quot;     
##  [6624] &quot;Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill.&quot;      
##  [6625] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6626] &quot;With a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling,&quot;      
##  [6627] &quot;from the persuasion of bringing comfort, she entered their room, saying,&quot;    
##  [6628] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6629] &quot;\&quot;Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good.\&quot;&quot;    
##  [6630] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6631] &quot;Marianne heard enough.  In one moment her imagination placed before her&quot;     
##  [6632] &quot;a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness and contrition,&quot;                
##  [6633] &quot;explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory, convincing; and&quot;           
##  [6634] &quot;instantly followed by Willoughby himself, rushing eagerly into the room&quot;     
##  [6635] &quot;to inforce, at her feet, by the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances&quot;       
##  [6636] &quot;of his letter.  The work of one moment was destroyed by the next.  The&quot;      
##  [6637] &quot;hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome, was before her;&quot;      
##  [6638] &quot;and, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an&quot;          
##  [6639] &quot;ecstasy of more than hope, she felt as if, till that instant, she had&quot;       
##  [6640] &quot;never suffered.&quot;                                                             
##  [6641] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6642] &quot;The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within her reach in her&quot;           
##  [6643] &quot;moments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed; and now she could&quot;      
##  [6644] &quot;reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with&quot;            
##  [6645] &quot;passionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely lost on its&quot;           
##  [6646] &quot;object, that after many expressions of pity, she withdrew, still&quot;            
##  [6647] &quot;referring her to the letter of comfort.  But the letter, when she was&quot;       
##  [6648] &quot;calm enough to read it, brought little comfort.  Willoughby filled&quot;          
##  [6649] &quot;every page.  Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and&quot;           
##  [6650] &quot;relying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by&quot;         
##  [6651] &quot;Elinor&#39;s application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards&quot;     
##  [6652] &quot;them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such affection&quot;       
##  [6653] &quot;for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future happiness in each&quot;     
##  [6654] &quot;other, that she wept with agony through the whole of it.&quot;                    
##  [6655] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6656] &quot;All her impatience to be at home again now returned; her mother was&quot;         
##  [6657] &quot;dearer to her than ever; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken&quot;     
##  [6658] &quot;confidence in Willoughby, and she was wildly urgent to be gone.&quot;             
##  [6659] &quot;Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne&quot;     
##  [6660] &quot;to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own except of&quot;       
##  [6661] &quot;patience till their mother&#39;s wishes could be known; and at length she&quot;       
##  [6662] &quot;obtained her sister&#39;s consent to wait for that knowledge.&quot;                   
##  [6663] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6664] &quot;Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she could not be easy&quot;       
##  [6665] &quot;till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself;&quot;     
##  [6666] &quot;and positively refusing Elinor&#39;s offered attendance, went out alone for&quot;     
##  [6667] &quot;the rest of the morning.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the&quot;     
##  [6668] &quot;pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne&#39;s&quot;            
##  [6669] &quot;letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it, then&quot;     
##  [6670] &quot;sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed, and entreat&quot;     
##  [6671] &quot;her directions for the future; while Marianne, who came into the&quot;            
##  [6672] &quot;drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings&#39;s going away, remained fixed at the table&quot;     
##  [6673] &quot;where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen, grieving over&quot;      
##  [6674] &quot;her for the hardship of such a task, and grieving still more fondly&quot;         
##  [6675] &quot;over its effect on her mother.&quot;                                              
##  [6676] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6677] &quot;In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, when&quot;          
##  [6678] &quot;Marianne, whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise, was&quot;            
##  [6679] &quot;startled by a rap at the door.&quot;                                              
##  [6680] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6681] &quot;\&quot;Who can this be?\&quot; cried Elinor.  \&quot;So early too! I thought we HAD been&quot;   
##  [6682] &quot;safe.\&quot;&quot;                                                                     
##  [6683] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6684] &quot;Marianne moved to the window--&quot;                                              
##  [6685] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6686] &quot;\&quot;It is Colonel Brandon!\&quot; said she, with vexation.  \&quot;We are never safe&quot;    
##  [6687] &quot;from HIM.\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [6688] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6689] &quot;\&quot;He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.\&quot;&quot;                     
##  [6690] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6691] &quot;\&quot;I will not trust to THAT,\&quot; retreating to her own room.  \&quot;A man who has&quot;  
##  [6692] &quot;nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on&quot;       
##  [6693] &quot;that of others.\&quot;&quot;                                                           
##  [6694] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6695] &quot;The event proved her conjecture right, though it was founded on&quot;             
##  [6696] &quot;injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon DID come in; and Elinor, who&quot;       
##  [6697] &quot;was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who&quot;     
##  [6698] &quot;saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look, and in his&quot;        
##  [6699] &quot;anxious though brief inquiry after her, could not forgive her sister&quot;        
##  [6700] &quot;for esteeming him so lightly.&quot;                                               
##  [6701] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6702] &quot;\&quot;I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street,\&quot; said he, after the first&quot;            
##  [6703] &quot;salutation, \&quot;and she encouraged me to come on; and I was the more&quot;          
##  [6704] &quot;easily encouraged, because I thought it probable that I might find you&quot;      
##  [6705] &quot;alone, which I was very desirous of doing.  My object--my wish--my sole&quot;     
##  [6706] &quot;wish in desiring it--I hope, I believe it is--is to be a means of&quot;           
##  [6707] &quot;giving comfort;--no, I must not say comfort--not present comfort--but&quot;       
##  [6708] &quot;conviction, lasting conviction to your sister&#39;s mind.  My regard for&quot;        
##  [6709] &quot;her, for yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it, by&quot;       
##  [6710] &quot;relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere&quot;                
##  [6711] &quot;regard--nothing but an earnest desire of being useful--I think I am&quot;         
##  [6712] &quot;justified--though where so many hours have been spent in convincing&quot;         
##  [6713] &quot;myself that I am right, is there not some reason to fear I may be&quot;           
##  [6714] &quot;wrong?\&quot; He stopped.&quot;                                                        
##  [6715] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6716] &quot;\&quot;I understand you,\&quot; said Elinor.  \&quot;You have something to tell me of Mr.&quot;  
##  [6717] &quot;Willoughby, that will open his character farther.  Your telling it will&quot;     
##  [6718] &quot;be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne.  MY&quot;           
##  [6719] &quot;gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to&quot;         
##  [6720] &quot;that end, and HERS must be gained by it in time.  Pray, pray let me&quot;         
##  [6721] &quot;hear it.\&quot;&quot;                                                                  
##  [6722] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6723] &quot;\&quot;You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,--but&quot;     
##  [6724] &quot;this will give you no idea--I must go farther back.  You will find me a&quot;     
##  [6725] &quot;very awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin.  A&quot;      
##  [6726] &quot;short account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it SHALL be&quot;      
##  [6727] &quot;a short one.  On such a subject,\&quot; sighing heavily, \&quot;can I have little&quot;     
##  [6728] &quot;temptation to be diffuse.\&quot;&quot;                                                 
##  [6729] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6730] &quot;He stopt a moment for recollection, and then, with another sigh, went&quot;       
##  [6731] &quot;on.&quot;                                                                         
##  [6732] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6733] &quot;\&quot;You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--(it is not to be&quot;     
##  [6734] &quot;supposed that it could make any impression on you)--a conversation&quot;          
##  [6735] &quot;between us one evening at Barton Park--it was the evening of a&quot;              
##  [6736] &quot;dance--in which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in&quot;     
##  [6737] &quot;some measure, your sister Marianne.\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [6738] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6739] &quot;\&quot;Indeed,\&quot; answered Elinor, \&quot;I have NOT forgotten it.\&quot; He looked pleased&quot; 
##  [6740] &quot;by this remembrance, and added,&quot;                                             
##  [6741] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6742] &quot;\&quot;If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender&quot;         
##  [6743] &quot;recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well&quot;      
##  [6744] &quot;in mind as person.  The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of&quot;         
##  [6745] &quot;fancy and spirits.  This lady was one of my nearest relations, an&quot;           
##  [6746] &quot;orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.  Our&quot;      
##  [6747] &quot;ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were&quot;              
##  [6748] &quot;playfellows and friends.  I cannot remember the time when I did not&quot;         
##  [6749] &quot;love Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as&quot;           
##  [6750] &quot;perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you&quot;         
##  [6751] &quot;might think me incapable of having ever felt.  Hers, for me, was, I&quot;         
##  [6752] &quot;believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and&quot;     
##  [6753] &quot;it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.  At&quot;             
##  [6754] &quot;seventeen she was lost to me for ever.  She was married--married&quot;            
##  [6755] &quot;against her inclination to my brother.  Her fortune was large, and our&quot;      
##  [6756] &quot;family estate much encumbered.  And this, I fear, is all that can be&quot;        
##  [6757] &quot;said for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.&quot;        
##  [6758] &quot;My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.  I had hoped&quot;      
##  [6759] &quot;that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty, and for&quot;      
##  [6760] &quot;some time it did; but at last the misery of her situation, for she&quot;          
##  [6761] &quot;experienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though&quot;       
##  [6762] &quot;she had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I relate!  I have&quot;         
##  [6763] &quot;never told you how this was brought on.  We were within a few hours of&quot;      
##  [6764] &quot;eloping together for Scotland.  The treachery, or the folly, of my&quot;          
##  [6765] &quot;cousin&#39;s maid betrayed us.  I was banished to the house of a relation&quot;       
##  [6766] &quot;far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,&quot;      
##  [6767] &quot;till my father&#39;s point was gained.  I had depended on her fortitude too&quot;     
##  [6768] &quot;far, and the blow was a severe one--but had her marriage been happy, so&quot;     
##  [6769] &quot;young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at&quot;      
##  [6770] &quot;least I should not have now to lament it.  This however was not the&quot;         
##  [6771] &quot;case.  My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not what&quot;        
##  [6772] &quot;they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her unkindly.&quot;        
##  [6773] &quot;The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so&quot;                
##  [6774] &quot;inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon&#39;s, was but too natural.  She resigned&quot;         
##  [6775] &quot;herself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it&quot;       
##  [6776] &quot;been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the&quot;               
##  [6777] &quot;remembrance of me occasioned.  But can we wonder that, with such a&quot;          
##  [6778] &quot;husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or&quot;           
##  [6779] &quot;restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their&quot;             
##  [6780] &quot;marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should&quot;         
##  [6781] &quot;fall?  Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I meant to promote the&quot;       
##  [6782] &quot;happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purpose&quot;      
##  [6783] &quot;had procured my exchange.  The shock which her marriage had given me,\&quot;&quot;     
##  [6784] &quot;he continued, in a voice of great agitation, \&quot;was of trifling&quot;              
##  [6785] &quot;weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years&quot;            
##  [6786] &quot;afterwards, of her divorce.  It was THAT which threw this gloom,--even&quot;      
##  [6787] &quot;now the recollection of what I suffered--\&quot;&quot;                                 
##  [6788] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6789] &quot;He could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about&quot;     
##  [6790] &quot;the room.  Elinor, affected by his relation, and still more by his&quot;          
##  [6791] &quot;distress, could not speak.  He saw her concern, and coming to her, took&quot;     
##  [6792] &quot;her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect.  A few&quot;           
##  [6793] &quot;minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.&quot;      
##  [6794] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6795] &quot;\&quot;It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned&quot;     
##  [6796] &quot;to England.  My first care, when I DID arrive, was of course to seek&quot;        
##  [6797] &quot;for her; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy.  I could&quot;     
##  [6798] &quot;not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to&quot;       
##  [6799] &quot;fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of&quot;         
##  [6800] &quot;sin.  Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor&quot;              
##  [6801] &quot;sufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my&quot;            
##  [6802] &quot;brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months&quot;       
##  [6803] &quot;before to another person.  He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it,&quot;     
##  [6804] &quot;that her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to&quot;          
##  [6805] &quot;dispose of it for some immediate relief.  At last, however, and after I&quot;     
##  [6806] &quot;had been six months in England, I DID find her.  Regard for a former&quot;        
##  [6807] &quot;servant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to&quot;      
##  [6808] &quot;visit him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; and&quot;          
##  [6809] &quot;there, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my unfortunate&quot;   
##  [6810] &quot;sister.  So altered--so faded--worn down by acute suffering of every&quot;        
##  [6811] &quot;kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before&quot;        
##  [6812] &quot;me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl, on whom&quot;      
##  [6813] &quot;I had once doted.  What I endured in so beholding her--but I have no&quot;        
##  [6814] &quot;right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it--I have&quot;           
##  [6815] &quot;pained you too much already.  That she was, to all appearance, in the&quot;       
##  [6816] &quot;last stage of a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was my&quot;        
##  [6817] &quot;greatest comfort.  Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving time&quot;        
##  [6818] &quot;for a better preparation for death; and that was given.  I saw her&quot;          
##  [6819] &quot;placed in comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited&quot;      
##  [6820] &quot;her every day during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her&quot;      
##  [6821] &quot;last moments.\&quot;&quot;                                                             
##  [6822] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6823] &quot;Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings in&quot;       
##  [6824] &quot;an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate friend.&quot;    
##  [6825] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6826] &quot;\&quot;Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,\&quot; said he, \&quot;by the resemblance&quot;  
##  [6827] &quot;I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation.  Their&quot;           
##  [6828] &quot;fates, their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet&quot;        
##  [6829] &quot;disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier&quot;          
##  [6830] &quot;marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see the other&quot;       
##  [6831] &quot;be.  But to what does all this lead?  I seem to have been distressing&quot;       
##  [6832] &quot;you for nothing.  Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched&quot;      
##  [6833] &quot;for fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!  I WILL be&quot;         
##  [6834] &quot;more collected--more concise.  She left to my care her only child, a&quot;        
##  [6835] &quot;little girl, the offspring of her first guilty connection, who was then&quot;     
##  [6836] &quot;about three years old.  She loved the child, and had always kept it&quot;         
##  [6837] &quot;with her.  It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would I&quot;      
##  [6838] &quot;have discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her&quot;             
##  [6839] &quot;education myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I&quot;        
##  [6840] &quot;had no family, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at&quot;         
##  [6841] &quot;school.  I saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my&quot;        
##  [6842] &quot;brother, (which happened about five years ago, and which left to me the&quot;     
##  [6843] &quot;possession of the family property,) she visited me at Delaford.  I&quot;          
##  [6844] &quot;called her a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have in&quot;           
##  [6845] &quot;general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her.  It is now&quot;     
##  [6846] &quot;three years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,) that I&quot;          
##  [6847] &quot;removed her from school, to place her under the care of a very&quot;              
##  [6848] &quot;respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four&quot;      
##  [6849] &quot;or five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I&quot;     
##  [6850] &quot;had every reason to be pleased with her situation.  But last February,&quot;      
##  [6851] &quot;almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.  I had allowed&quot;         
##  [6852] &quot;her, (imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire,&quot;      
##  [6853] &quot;to go to Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending her&quot;          
##  [6854] &quot;father there for his health.  I knew him to be a very good sort of man,&quot;     
##  [6855] &quot;and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved, for, with&quot;     
##  [6856] &quot;a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would&quot;      
##  [6857] &quot;give no clue, though she certainly knew all.  He, her father, a&quot;             
##  [6858] &quot;well-meaning, but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe,&quot;         
##  [6859] &quot;give no information; for he had been generally confined to the house,&quot;       
##  [6860] &quot;while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance&quot;     
##  [6861] &quot;they chose; and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was&quot;            
##  [6862] &quot;convinced himself, of his daughter&#39;s being entirely unconcerned in the&quot;      
##  [6863] &quot;business.  In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone; all&quot;       
##  [6864] &quot;the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.  What I&quot;            
##  [6865] &quot;thought, what I feared, may be imagined; and what I suffered too.\&quot;&quot;         
##  [6866] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6867] &quot;\&quot;Good heavens!\&quot; cried Elinor, \&quot;could it be--could Willoughby!\&quot;--&quot;        
##  [6868] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6869] &quot;\&quot;The first news that reached me of her,\&quot; he continued, \&quot;came in a&quot;        
##  [6870] &quot;letter from herself, last October.  It was forwarded to me from&quot;             
##  [6871] &quot;Delaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party&quot;       
##  [6872] &quot;to Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,&quot;      
##  [6873] &quot;which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body,&quot;       
##  [6874] &quot;and which I believe gave offence to some.  Little did Mr. Willoughby&quot;        
##  [6875] &quot;imagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in&quot;            
##  [6876] &quot;breaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom&quot;     
##  [6877] &quot;he had made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it, what would it have&quot;     
##  [6878] &quot;availed?  Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of&quot;        
##  [6879] &quot;your sister?  No, he had already done that, which no man who CAN feel&quot;       
##  [6880] &quot;for another would do.  He had left the girl whose youth and innocence&quot;       
##  [6881] &quot;he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with no&quot;              
##  [6882] &quot;creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address!  He had&quot;      
##  [6883] &quot;left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor&quot;          
##  [6884] &quot;relieved her.\&quot;&quot;                                                             
##  [6885] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6886] &quot;\&quot;This is beyond every thing!\&quot; exclaimed Elinor.&quot;                           
##  [6887] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6888] &quot;\&quot;His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse than&quot;    
##  [6889] &quot;both.  Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess what&quot;      
##  [6890] &quot;I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever, and on&quot;       
##  [6891] &quot;being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt&quot;        
##  [6892] &quot;for all your sakes.  When I came to you last week and found you alone,&quot;      
##  [6893] &quot;I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to do when&quot;      
##  [6894] &quot;it WAS known.  My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; but&quot;       
##  [6895] &quot;now you will comprehend it.  To suffer you all to be so deceived; to&quot;        
##  [6896] &quot;see your sister--but what could I do?  I had no hope of interfering&quot;         
##  [6897] &quot;with success; and sometimes I thought your sister&#39;s influence might yet&quot;     
##  [6898] &quot;reclaim him.  But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what&quot;     
##  [6899] &quot;were his designs on her.  Whatever they may have been, however, she may&quot;     
##  [6900] &quot;now, and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own&quot;       
##  [6901] &quot;condition, when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she&quot;        
##  [6902] &quot;considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and&quot;        
##  [6903] &quot;pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong, still as&quot;      
##  [6904] &quot;strong as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which&quot;        
##  [6905] &quot;must attend her through life.  Surely this comparison must have its use&quot;     
##  [6906] &quot;with her.  She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.  They&quot;            
##  [6907] &quot;proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.  On the&quot;              
##  [6908] &quot;contrary, every friend must be made still more her friend by them.&quot;          
##  [6909] &quot;Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for her fortitude under it,&quot;        
##  [6910] &quot;must strengthen every attachment.  Use your own discretion, however, in&quot;     
##  [6911] &quot;communicating to her what I have told you.  You must know best what&quot;         
##  [6912] &quot;will be its effect; but had I not seriously, and from my heart believed&quot;     
##  [6913] &quot;it might be of service, might lessen her regrets, I would not have&quot;          
##  [6914] &quot;suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family&quot;               
##  [6915] &quot;afflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been intended to&quot;         
##  [6916] &quot;raise myself at the expense of others.\&quot;&quot;                                    
##  [6917] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6918] &quot;Elinor&#39;s thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness;&quot;             
##  [6919] &quot;attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to&quot;      
##  [6920] &quot;Marianne, from the communication of what had passed.&quot;                        
##  [6921] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6922] &quot;\&quot;I have been more pained,\&quot; said she, \&quot;by her endeavors to acquit him&quot;     
##  [6923] &quot;than by all the rest; for it irritates her mind more than the most&quot;          
##  [6924] &quot;perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do.  Now, though at first&quot;        
##  [6925] &quot;she will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier.  Have&quot;          
##  [6926] &quot;you,\&quot; she continued, after a short silence, \&quot;ever seen Mr. Willoughby&quot;     
##  [6927] &quot;since you left him at Barton?\&quot;&quot;                                             
##  [6928] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6929] &quot;\&quot;Yes,\&quot; he replied gravely, \&quot;once I have.  One meeting was unavoidable.\&quot;&quot; 
##  [6930] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6931] &quot;Elinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously, saying,&quot;            
##  [6932] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6933] &quot;\&quot;What? have you met him to--\&quot;&quot;                                             
##  [6934] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6935] &quot;\&quot;I could meet him no other way.  Eliza had confessed to me, though most&quot;    
##  [6936] &quot;reluctantly, the name of her lover; and when he returned to town, which&quot;     
##  [6937] &quot;was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he to&quot;           
##  [6938] &quot;defend, I to punish his conduct.  We returned unwounded, and the&quot;            
##  [6939] &quot;meeting, therefore, never got abroad.\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [6940] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6941] &quot;Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and a&quot;        
##  [6942] &quot;soldier she presumed not to censure it.&quot;                                     
##  [6943] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6944] &quot;\&quot;Such,\&quot; said Colonel Brandon, after a pause, \&quot;has been the unhappy&quot;       
##  [6945] &quot;resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter! and so imperfectly&quot;     
##  [6946] &quot;have I discharged my trust!\&quot;&quot;                                               
##  [6947] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6948] &quot;\&quot;Is she still in town?\&quot;&quot;                                                   
##  [6949] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6950] &quot;\&quot;No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in, for I found her near&quot;      
##  [6951] &quot;her delivery, I removed her and her child into the country, and there&quot;       
##  [6952] &quot;she remains.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
##  [6953] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6954] &quot;Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably dividing Elinor&quot;         
##  [6955] &quot;from her sister, he put an end to his visit, receiving from her again&quot;       
##  [6956] &quot;the same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her full of compassion&quot;       
##  [6957] &quot;and esteem for him.&quot;                                                         
##  [6958] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6959] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6960] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6961] &quot;CHAPTER 32&quot;                                                                  
##  [6962] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6963] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6964] &quot;When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss&quot;             
##  [6965] &quot;Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was&quot;       
##  [6966] &quot;not entirely such as the former had hoped to see.  Not that Marianne&quot;        
##  [6967] &quot;appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to&quot;       
##  [6968] &quot;it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither&quot;          
##  [6969] &quot;objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and&quot;           
##  [6970] &quot;seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible.  But&quot;         
##  [6971] &quot;though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt&quot;      
##  [6972] &quot;WAS carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the&quot;          
##  [6973] &quot;effect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,&quot;     
##  [6974] &quot;in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of&quot;           
##  [6975] &quot;compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less violently&quot;        
##  [6976] &quot;irritated than before, she did not see her less wretched.  Her mind did&quot;     
##  [6977] &quot;become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.  She felt the&quot;     
##  [6978] &quot;loss of Willoughby&#39;s character yet more heavily than she had felt the&quot;       
##  [6979] &quot;loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the&quot;        
##  [6980] &quot;misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE&quot;      
##  [6981] &quot;have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits, that&quot;        
##  [6982] &quot;she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor;&quot;       
##  [6983] &quot;and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her sister&quot;     
##  [6984] &quot;than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent&quot;        
##  [6985] &quot;confession of them.&quot;                                                         
##  [6986] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6987] &quot;To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and&quot;      
##  [6988] &quot;answering Elinor&#39;s letter would be only to give a repetition of what&quot;        
##  [6989] &quot;her daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly&quot;         
##  [6990] &quot;less painful than Marianne&#39;s, and an indignation even greater than&quot;          
##  [6991] &quot;Elinor&#39;s.  Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,&quot;            
##  [6992] &quot;arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her&quot;           
##  [6993] &quot;anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with&quot;         
##  [6994] &quot;fortitude under this misfortune.  Bad indeed must the nature of&quot;             
##  [6995] &quot;Marianne&#39;s affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude!&quot;          
##  [6996] &quot;mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which&quot;       
##  [6997] &quot;SHE could wish her not to indulge!&quot;                                          
##  [6998] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [6999] &quot;Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had&quot;       
##  [7000] &quot;determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at&quot;         
##  [7001] &quot;that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be&quot;       
##  [7002] &quot;bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by&quot;      
##  [7003] &quot;constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen&quot;       
##  [7004] &quot;him there.  She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all&quot;          
##  [7005] &quot;means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which,&quot;     
##  [7006] &quot;though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at&quot;         
##  [7007] &quot;least five or six weeks.  A variety of occupations, of objects, and of&quot;      
##  [7008] &quot;company, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitable&quot;         
##  [7009] &quot;there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into some&quot;        
##  [7010] &quot;interest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as the&quot;          
##  [7011] &quot;ideas of both might now be spurned by her.&quot;                                  
##  [7012] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7013] &quot;From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her&quot;       
##  [7014] &quot;to be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his&quot;            
##  [7015] &quot;acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her&quot;           
##  [7016] &quot;friends.  Design could never bring them in each other&#39;s way: negligence&quot;     
##  [7017] &quot;could never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in&quot;        
##  [7018] &quot;its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of&quot;            
##  [7019] &quot;Barton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit at&quot;      
##  [7020] &quot;Allenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at first&quot;     
##  [7021] &quot;as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain one.&quot;        
##  [7022] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7023] &quot;She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where&quot;         
##  [7024] &quot;they were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his&quot;        
##  [7025] &quot;wife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged&quot;       
##  [7026] &quot;it right that they should sometimes see their brother.&quot;                      
##  [7027] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7028] &quot;Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother&#39;s opinion, and she&quot;         
##  [7029] &quot;submitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved&quot;              
##  [7030] &quot;perfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she felt&quot;      
##  [7031] &quot;it to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by&quot;            
##  [7032] &quot;requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only&quot;      
##  [7033] &quot;possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her&quot;      
##  [7034] &quot;mother, and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent&quot;      
##  [7035] &quot;her ever knowing a moment&#39;s rest.&quot;                                           
##  [7036] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7037] &quot;But it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what brought evil&quot;     
##  [7038] &quot;to herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the other&quot;         
##  [7039] &quot;hand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward&quot;          
##  [7040] &quot;entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer stay&quot;      
##  [7041] &quot;would therefore militate against her own happiness, it would be better&quot;      
##  [7042] &quot;for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.&quot;                      
##  [7043] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7044] &quot;Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby&#39;s&quot;       
##  [7045] &quot;name mentioned, was not thrown away.  Marianne, though without knowing&quot;      
##  [7046] &quot;it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor&quot;        
##  [7047] &quot;Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.&quot;       
##  [7048] &quot;Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards&quot;         
##  [7049] &quot;herself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day&quot;         
##  [7050] &quot;after day to the indignation of them all.&quot;                                   
##  [7051] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7052] &quot;Sir John, could not have thought it possible.  \&quot;A man of whom he had&quot;       
##  [7053] &quot;always had such reason to think well!  Such a good-natured fellow!  He&quot;      
##  [7054] &quot;did not believe there was a bolder rider in England!  It was an&quot;             
##  [7055] &quot;unaccountable business.  He wished him at the devil with all his heart.&quot;     
##  [7056] &quot;He would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, for&quot;        
##  [7057] &quot;all the world!  No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert,&quot;      
##  [7058] &quot;and they were kept watching for two hours together.  Such a scoundrel&quot;       
##  [7059] &quot;of a fellow! such a deceitful dog!  It was only the last time they met&quot;      
##  [7060] &quot;that he had offered him one of Folly&#39;s puppies! and this was the end of&quot;     
##  [7061] &quot;it!\&quot;&quot;                                                                       
##  [7062] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7063] &quot;Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry.  \&quot;She was determined to&quot;        
##  [7064] &quot;drop his acquaintance immediately, and she was very thankful that she&quot;       
##  [7065] &quot;had never been acquainted with him at all.  She wished with all her&quot;         
##  [7066] &quot;heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify,&quot;        
##  [7067] &quot;for it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated him so much&quot;         
##  [7068] &quot;that she was resolved never to mention his name again, and she should&quot;       
##  [7069] &quot;tell everybody she saw, how good-for-nothing he was.\&quot;&quot;                      
##  [7070] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7071] &quot;The rest of Mrs. Palmer&#39;s sympathy was shewn in procuring all the&quot;           
##  [7072] &quot;particulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and communicating&quot;     
##  [7073] &quot;them to Elinor.  She could soon tell at what coachmaker&#39;s the new&quot;           
##  [7074] &quot;carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby&#39;s portrait was&quot;        
##  [7075] &quot;drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey&#39;s clothes might be seen.&quot;             
##  [7076] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7077] &quot;The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a&quot;       
##  [7078] &quot;happy relief to Elinor&#39;s spirits, oppressed as they often were by the&quot;       
##  [7079] &quot;clamorous kindness of the others.  It was a great comfort to her to be&quot;      
##  [7080] &quot;sure of exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their circle&quot;      
##  [7081] &quot;of friends: a great comfort to know that there was ONE who would meet&quot;       
##  [7082] &quot;her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any anxiety for&quot;     
##  [7083] &quot;her sister&#39;s health.&quot;                                                        
##  [7084] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7085] &quot;Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the&quot;         
##  [7086] &quot;moment, to more than its real value; and she was sometimes worried down&quot;     
##  [7087] &quot;by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more indispensable to&quot;      
##  [7088] &quot;comfort than good-nature.&quot;                                                   
##  [7089] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7090] &quot;Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day,&quot;      
##  [7091] &quot;or twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, \&quot;It is very&quot;       
##  [7092] &quot;shocking, indeed!\&quot; and by the means of this continual though gentle&quot;        
##  [7093] &quot;vent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first&quot;            
##  [7094] &quot;without the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without&quot;             
##  [7095] &quot;recollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the&quot;            
##  [7096] &quot;dignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was&quot;          
##  [7097] &quot;wrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the&quot;         
##  [7098] &quot;interest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined (though rather&quot;     
##  [7099] &quot;against the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once&quot;      
##  [7100] &quot;be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her as soon&quot;      
##  [7101] &quot;as she married.&quot;                                                             
##  [7102] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7103] &quot;Colonel Brandon&#39;s delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome&quot;      
##  [7104] &quot;to Miss Dashwood.  He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate&quot;       
##  [7105] &quot;discussion of her sister&#39;s disappointment, by the friendly zeal with&quot;        
##  [7106] &quot;which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with&quot;       
##  [7107] &quot;confidence.  His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing&quot;        
##  [7108] &quot;past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye&quot;         
##  [7109] &quot;with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her&quot;       
##  [7110] &quot;voice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or&quot;         
##  [7111] &quot;could oblige herself to speak to him.  THESE assured him that his&quot;           
##  [7112] &quot;exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and&quot;         
##  [7113] &quot;THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; but&quot;       
##  [7114] &quot;Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the&quot;         
##  [7115] &quot;Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither prevail&quot;      
##  [7116] &quot;on him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make it for&quot;         
##  [7117] &quot;him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of&quot;               
##  [7118] &quot;Midsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end of&quot;     
##  [7119] &quot;a week that it would not be a match at all.  The good understanding&quot;         
##  [7120] &quot;between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the&quot;     
##  [7121] &quot;honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would all&quot;      
##  [7122] &quot;be made over to HER; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased to&quot;         
##  [7123] &quot;think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.&quot;                                               
##  [7124] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7125] &quot;Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby&#39;s&quot;      
##  [7126] &quot;letter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he&quot;       
##  [7127] &quot;was married.  She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to&quot;       
##  [7128] &quot;herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she was&quot;     
##  [7129] &quot;desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from&quot;       
##  [7130] &quot;the public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every morning.&quot;       
##  [7131] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7132] &quot;She received the news with resolute composure; made no observation on&quot;       
##  [7133] &quot;it, and at first shed no tears; but after a short time they would burst&quot;     
##  [7134] &quot;out, and for the rest of the day, she was in a state hardly less&quot;            
##  [7135] &quot;pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event.&quot;                    
##  [7136] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7137] &quot;The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now&quot;      
##  [7138] &quot;hoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them, to&quot;         
##  [7139] &quot;prevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow&quot;      
##  [7140] &quot;first fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before.&quot;              
##  [7141] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7142] &quot;About this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin&#39;s&quot;      
##  [7143] &quot;house in Bartlett&#39;s Buildings, Holburn, presented themselves again&quot;          
##  [7144] &quot;before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; and&quot;      
##  [7145] &quot;were welcomed by them all with great cordiality.&quot;                            
##  [7146] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7147] &quot;Elinor only was sorry to see them.  Their presence always gave her&quot;          
##  [7148] &quot;pain, and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the&quot;         
##  [7149] &quot;overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her STILL in town.&quot;                  
##  [7150] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7151] &quot;\&quot;I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here&quot;         
##  [7152] &quot;STILL,\&quot; said she repeatedly, with a strong emphasis on the word.  \&quot;But&quot;    
##  [7153] &quot;I always thought I SHOULD.  I was almost sure you would not leave&quot;           
##  [7154] &quot;London yet awhile; though you TOLD me, you know, at Barton, that you&quot;        
##  [7155] &quot;should not stay above a MONTH.  But I thought, at the time, that you&quot;        
##  [7156] &quot;would most likely change your mind when it came to the point.  It would&quot;     
##  [7157] &quot;have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and&quot;       
##  [7158] &quot;sister came.  And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone.  I&quot;     
##  [7159] &quot;am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD.\&quot;&quot;                          
##  [7160] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7161] &quot;Elinor perfectly understood her, and was forced to use all her&quot;              
##  [7162] &quot;self-command to make it appear that she did NOT.&quot;                            
##  [7163] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7164] &quot;\&quot;Well, my dear,\&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, \&quot;and how did you travel?\&quot;&quot;          
##  [7165] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7166] &quot;\&quot;Not in the stage, I assure you,\&quot; replied Miss Steele, with quick&quot;         
##  [7167] &quot;exultation; \&quot;we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to&quot;        
##  [7168] &quot;attend us.  Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought we&#39;d join&quot;      
##  [7169] &quot;him in a post-chaise; and he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or&quot;        
##  [7170] &quot;twelve shillings more than we did.\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [7171] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7172] &quot;\&quot;Oh, oh!\&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings; \&quot;very pretty, indeed! and the Doctor is&quot;   
##  [7173] &quot;a single man, I warrant you.\&quot;&quot;                                              
##  [7174] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7175] &quot;\&quot;There now,\&quot; said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering, \&quot;everybody laughs&quot;   
##  [7176] &quot;at me so about the Doctor, and I cannot think why.  My cousins say they&quot;     
##  [7177] &quot;are sure I have made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never&quot;          
##  [7178] &quot;think about him from one hour&#39;s end to another.  &#39;Lord! here comes your&quot;     
##  [7179] &quot;beau, Nancy,&#39; my cousin said t&#39;other day, when she saw him crossing the&quot;     
##  [7180] &quot;street to the house.  My beau, indeed! said I--I cannot think who you&quot;       
##  [7181] &quot;mean.  The Doctor is no beau of mine.\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [7182] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7183] &quot;\&quot;Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--but it won&#39;t do--the Doctor is&quot;     
##  [7184] &quot;the man, I see.\&quot;&quot;                                                           
##  [7185] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7186] &quot;\&quot;No, indeed!\&quot; replied her cousin, with affected earnestness, \&quot;and I beg&quot;  
##  [7187] &quot;you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of.\&quot;&quot;                    
##  [7188] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7189] &quot;Mrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she&quot;           
##  [7190] &quot;certainly would NOT, and Miss Steele was made completely happy.&quot;             
##  [7191] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7192] &quot;\&quot;I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, Miss&quot;         
##  [7193] &quot;Dashwood, when they come to town,\&quot; said Lucy, returning, after a&quot;           
##  [7194] &quot;cessation of hostile hints, to the charge.&quot;                                  
##  [7195] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7196] &quot;\&quot;No, I do not think we shall.\&quot;&quot;                                            
##  [7197] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7198] &quot;\&quot;Oh, yes, I dare say you will.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [7199] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7200] &quot;Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition.&quot;                          
##  [7201] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7202] &quot;\&quot;What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for&quot;     
##  [7203] &quot;so long a time together!\&quot;&quot;                                                  
##  [7204] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7205] &quot;\&quot;Long a time, indeed!\&quot; interposed Mrs. Jennings.  \&quot;Why, their visit is&quot;   
##  [7206] &quot;but just begun!\&quot;&quot;                                                           
##  [7207] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7208] &quot;Lucy was silenced.&quot;                                                          
##  [7209] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7210] &quot;\&quot;I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood,\&quot; said Miss&quot;          
##  [7211] &quot;Steele.  \&quot;I am sorry she is not well--\&quot; for Marianne had left the room&quot;    
##  [7212] &quot;on their arrival.&quot;                                                           
##  [7213] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7214] &quot;\&quot;You are very good.  My sister will be equally sorry to miss the&quot;           
##  [7215] &quot;pleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with&quot;      
##  [7216] &quot;nervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation.\&quot;&quot;     
##  [7217] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7218] &quot;\&quot;Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and&quot;          
##  [7219] &quot;me!--I think she might see US; and I am sure we would not speak a word.\&quot;&quot;   
##  [7220] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7221] &quot;Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal.  Her sister was&quot;         
##  [7222] &quot;perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore&quot;      
##  [7223] &quot;not able to come to them.&quot;                                                   
##  [7224] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7225] &quot;\&quot;Oh, if that&#39;s all,\&quot; cried Miss Steele, \&quot;we can just as well go and see&quot;  
##  [7226] &quot;HER.\&quot;&quot;                                                                      
##  [7227] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7228] &quot;Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper; but she&quot;     
##  [7229] &quot;was saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucy&#39;s sharp reprimand, which&quot;      
##  [7230] &quot;now, as on many occasions, though it did not give much sweetness to the&quot;     
##  [7231] &quot;manners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of the other.&quot;    
##  [7232] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7233] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7234] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7235] &quot;CHAPTER 33&quot;                                                                  
##  [7236] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7237] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7238] &quot;After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister&#39;s entreaties, and&quot;     
##  [7239] &quot;consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an&quot;      
##  [7240] &quot;hour. She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, and&quot;         
##  [7241] &quot;would do no more than accompany them to Gray&#39;s in Sackville Street,&quot;         
##  [7242] &quot;where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few&quot;        
##  [7243] &quot;old-fashioned jewels of her mother.&quot;                                         
##  [7244] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7245] &quot;When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was&quot;     
##  [7246] &quot;a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call; and as&quot;     
##  [7247] &quot;she had no business at Gray&#39;s, it was resolved, that while her young&quot;        
##  [7248] &quot;friends transacted their&#39;s, she should pay her visit and return for&quot;         
##  [7249] &quot;them.&quot;                                                                       
##  [7250] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7251] &quot;On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before&quot;     
##  [7252] &quot;them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend to&quot;         
##  [7253] &quot;their orders; and they were obliged to wait.  All that could be done&quot;        
##  [7254] &quot;was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the&quot;     
##  [7255] &quot;quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is&quot;       
##  [7256] &quot;probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to&quot;     
##  [7257] &quot;a quicker despatch.  But the correctness of his eye, and the delicacy&quot;       
##  [7258] &quot;of his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness.  He was giving orders&quot;     
##  [7259] &quot;for a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size, shape, and&quot;             
##  [7260] &quot;ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining and debating&quot;       
##  [7261] &quot;for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop, were&quot;        
##  [7262] &quot;finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no leisure to&quot;           
##  [7263] &quot;bestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was comprised&quot;       
##  [7264] &quot;in three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which served to&quot;        
##  [7265] &quot;imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong,&quot;          
##  [7266] &quot;natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first style of&quot;      
##  [7267] &quot;fashion.&quot;                                                                    
##  [7268] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7269] &quot;Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and&quot;           
##  [7270] &quot;resentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on&quot;       
##  [7271] &quot;the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of&quot;      
##  [7272] &quot;the different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining&quot;     
##  [7273] &quot;unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts&quot;     
##  [7274] &quot;within herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing around her, in&quot;       
##  [7275] &quot;Mr. Gray&#39;s shop, as in her own bedroom.&quot;                                     
##  [7276] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7277] &quot;At last the affair was decided.  The ivory, the gold, and the pearls,&quot;       
##  [7278] &quot;all received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the last&quot;     
##  [7279] &quot;day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of&quot;     
##  [7280] &quot;the toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care, and&quot;             
##  [7281] &quot;bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a one as&quot;           
##  [7282] &quot;seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off with a&quot;          
##  [7283] &quot;happy air of real conceit and affected indifference.&quot;                        
##  [7284] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7285] &quot;Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point&quot;      
##  [7286] &quot;of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her side.&quot;     
##  [7287] &quot;She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some surprise&quot;      
##  [7288] &quot;to be her brother.&quot;                                                          
##  [7289] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7290] &quot;Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very&quot;      
##  [7291] &quot;creditable appearance in Mr. Gray&#39;s shop.  John Dashwood was really far&quot;     
##  [7292] &quot;from being sorry to see his sisters again; it rather gave them&quot;              
##  [7293] &quot;satisfaction; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and&quot;      
##  [7294] &quot;attentive.&quot;                                                                  
##  [7295] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7296] &quot;Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days.&quot;                   
##  [7297] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7298] &quot;\&quot;I wished very much to call upon you yesterday,\&quot; said he, \&quot;but it was&quot;    
##  [7299] &quot;impossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at&quot;     
##  [7300] &quot;Exeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars.&quot;        
##  [7301] &quot;Harry was vastly pleased.  THIS morning I had fully intended to call on&quot;     
##  [7302] &quot;you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always so&quot;      
##  [7303] &quot;much to do on first coming to town.  I am come here to bespeak Fanny a&quot;      
##  [7304] &quot;seal.  But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in&quot;            
##  [7305] &quot;Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings.  I&quot;         
##  [7306] &quot;understand she is a woman of very good fortune.  And the Middletons&quot;         
##  [7307] &quot;too, you must introduce me to THEM.  As my mother-in-law&#39;s relations, I&quot;     
##  [7308] &quot;shall be happy to show them every respect.  They are excellent&quot;              
##  [7309] &quot;neighbours to you in the country, I understand.\&quot;&quot;                           
##  [7310] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7311] &quot;\&quot;Excellent indeed.  Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness&quot;     
##  [7312] &quot;in every particular, is more than I can express.\&quot;&quot;                          
##  [7313] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7314] &quot;\&quot;I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word; extremely glad indeed.&quot;      
##  [7315] &quot;But so it ought to be; they are people of large fortune, they are&quot;           
##  [7316] &quot;related to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve to&quot;      
##  [7317] &quot;make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected.  And so you&quot;      
##  [7318] &quot;are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for&quot;            
##  [7319] &quot;nothing!  Edward brought us a most charming account of the place: the&quot;       
##  [7320] &quot;most complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was, and you all&quot;        
##  [7321] &quot;seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing.  It was a great satisfaction to us&quot;     
##  [7322] &quot;to hear it, I assure you.\&quot;&quot;                                                 
##  [7323] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7324] &quot;Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother; and was not sorry to&quot;       
##  [7325] &quot;be spared the necessity of answering him, by the arrival of Mrs.&quot;            
##  [7326] &quot;Jennings&#39;s servant, who came to tell her that his mistress waited for&quot;       
##  [7327] &quot;them at the door.&quot;                                                           
##  [7328] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7329] &quot;Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings&quot;     
##  [7330] &quot;at the door of her carriage, and repeating his hope of being able to&quot;        
##  [7331] &quot;call on them the next day, took leave.&quot;                                      
##  [7332] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7333] &quot;His visit was duly paid.  He came with a pretence at an apology from&quot;        
##  [7334] &quot;their sister-in-law, for not coming too; \&quot;but she was so much engaged&quot;      
##  [7335] &quot;with her mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where.\&quot;&quot;      
##  [7336] &quot;Mrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not stand&quot;     
##  [7337] &quot;upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like it, and she&quot;     
##  [7338] &quot;should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring her&quot;        
##  [7339] &quot;sisters to see her.  His manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectly&quot;       
##  [7340] &quot;kind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel&quot;              
##  [7341] &quot;Brandon&#39;s coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a curiosity&quot;        
##  [7342] &quot;which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be rich, to be&quot;      
##  [7343] &quot;equally civil to HIM.&quot;                                                       
##  [7344] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7345] &quot;After staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him&quot;      
##  [7346] &quot;to Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.&quot;        
##  [7347] &quot;The weather was remarkably fine, and she readily consented.  As soon as&quot;     
##  [7348] &quot;they were out of the house, his enquiries began.&quot;                            
##  [7349] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7350] &quot;\&quot;Who is Colonel Brandon?  Is he a man of fortune?\&quot;&quot;                        
##  [7351] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7352] &quot;\&quot;Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire.\&quot;&quot;                          
##  [7353] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7354] &quot;\&quot;I am glad of it.  He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think,&quot;         
##  [7355] &quot;Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable&quot;        
##  [7356] &quot;establishment in life.\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [7357] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7358] &quot;\&quot;Me, brother! what do you mean?\&quot;&quot;                                          
##  [7359] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7360] &quot;\&quot;He likes you.  I observed him narrowly, and am convinced of it.  What&quot;     
##  [7361] &quot;is the amount of his fortune?\&quot;&quot;                                             
##  [7362] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7363] &quot;\&quot;I believe about two thousand a year.\&quot;&quot;                                    
##  [7364] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7365] &quot;\&quot;Two thousand a-year;\&quot; and then working himself up to a pitch of&quot;          
##  [7366] &quot;enthusiastic generosity, he added, \&quot;Elinor, I wish with all my heart it&quot;    
##  [7367] &quot;were TWICE as much, for your sake.\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [7368] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7369] &quot;\&quot;Indeed I believe you,\&quot; replied Elinor; \&quot;but I am very sure that&quot;         
##  [7370] &quot;Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME.\&quot;&quot;                 
##  [7371] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7372] &quot;\&quot;You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken.  A very little&quot;      
##  [7373] &quot;trouble on your side secures him.  Perhaps just at present he may be&quot;        
##  [7374] &quot;undecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; his&quot;        
##  [7375] &quot;friends may all advise him against it.  But some of those little&quot;            
##  [7376] &quot;attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix&quot;      
##  [7377] &quot;him, in spite of himself.  And there can be no reason why you should&quot;        
##  [7378] &quot;not try for him.  It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on&quot;     
##  [7379] &quot;your side--in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is&quot;       
##  [7380] &quot;quite out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--you have&quot;      
##  [7381] &quot;too much sense not to see all that.  Colonel Brandon must be the man;&quot;       
##  [7382] &quot;and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with&quot;        
##  [7383] &quot;you and your family.  It is a match that must give universal&quot;                
##  [7384] &quot;satisfaction.  In short, it is a kind of thing that\&quot;--lowering his&quot;         
##  [7385] &quot;voice to an important whisper--\&quot;will be exceedingly welcome to ALL&quot;         
##  [7386] &quot;PARTIES.\&quot; Recollecting himself, however, he added, \&quot;That is, I mean to&quot;    
##  [7387] &quot;say--your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled; Fanny&quot;      
##  [7388] &quot;particularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I assure&quot;        
##  [7389] &quot;you.  And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am&quot;     
##  [7390] &quot;sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much the other day.\&quot;&quot;    
##  [7391] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7392] &quot;Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.&quot;                                      
##  [7393] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7394] &quot;\&quot;It would be something remarkable, now,\&quot; he continued, \&quot;something&quot;        
##  [7395] &quot;droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the&quot;        
##  [7396] &quot;same time.  And yet it is not very unlikely.\&quot;&quot;                              
##  [7397] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7398] &quot;\&quot;Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,\&quot; said Elinor, with resolution, \&quot;going to be&quot;      
##  [7399] &quot;married?\&quot;&quot;                                                                  
##  [7400] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7401] &quot;\&quot;It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation.&quot;       
##  [7402] &quot;He has a most excellent mother.  Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost&quot;              
##  [7403] &quot;liberality, will come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, if&quot;      
##  [7404] &quot;the match takes place.  The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter&quot;     
##  [7405] &quot;of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds.  A very desirable&quot;     
##  [7406] &quot;connection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place in&quot;     
##  [7407] &quot;time.  A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away, to&quot;      
##  [7408] &quot;make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit.  To give you&quot;       
##  [7409] &quot;another instance of her liberality:--The other day, as soon as we came&quot;      
##  [7410] &quot;to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now,&quot;        
##  [7411] &quot;she put bank-notes into Fanny&#39;s hands to the amount of two hundred&quot;          
##  [7412] &quot;pounds.  And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great&quot;        
##  [7413] &quot;expense while we are here.\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [7414] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7415] &quot;He paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to say,&quot;     
##  [7416] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7417] &quot;\&quot;Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable;&quot;    
##  [7418] &quot;but your income is a large one.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [7419] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7420] &quot;\&quot;Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose.  I do not mean to&quot;       
##  [7421] &quot;complain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope will&quot;     
##  [7422] &quot;in time be better.  The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on,&quot;       
##  [7423] &quot;is a most serious drain.  And then I have made a little purchase within&quot;     
##  [7424] &quot;this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place, where&quot;       
##  [7425] &quot;old Gibson used to live.  The land was so very desirable for me in&quot;          
##  [7426] &quot;every respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it&quot;     
##  [7427] &quot;my duty to buy it.  I could not have answered it to my conscience to&quot;        
##  [7428] &quot;let it fall into any other hands.  A man must pay for his convenience;&quot;      
##  [7429] &quot;and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money.\&quot;&quot;                                  
##  [7430] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7431] &quot;\&quot;More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.\&quot;&quot;                  
##  [7432] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7433] &quot;\&quot;Why, I hope not that.  I might have sold it again, the next day, for&quot;      
##  [7434] &quot;more than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have&quot;      
##  [7435] &quot;been very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,&quot;      
##  [7436] &quot;that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker&#39;s&quot;         
##  [7437] &quot;hands, I must have sold out to very great loss.\&quot;&quot;                           
##  [7438] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7439] &quot;Elinor could only smile.&quot;                                                    
##  [7440] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7441] &quot;\&quot;Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to&quot;    
##  [7442] &quot;Norland.  Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the&quot;        
##  [7443] &quot;Stanhill effects that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)&quot;     
##  [7444] &quot;to your mother.  Far be it from me to repine at his doing so; he had an&quot;     
##  [7445] &quot;undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose, but, in&quot;         
##  [7446] &quot;consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large purchases of&quot;          
##  [7447] &quot;linen, china, &amp;c. to supply the place of what was taken away.  You may&quot;      
##  [7448] &quot;guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be from being&quot;         
##  [7449] &quot;rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s kindness is.\&quot;&quot;                      
##  [7450] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7451] &quot;\&quot;Certainly,\&quot; said Elinor; \&quot;and assisted by her liberality, I hope you&quot;    
##  [7452] &quot;may yet live to be in easy circumstances.\&quot;&quot;                                 
##  [7453] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7454] &quot;\&quot;Another year or two may do much towards it,\&quot; he gravely replied; \&quot;but&quot;   
##  [7455] &quot;however there is still a great deal to be done.  There is not a stone&quot;       
##  [7456] &quot;laid of Fanny&#39;s green-house, and nothing but the plan of the&quot;                
##  [7457] &quot;flower-garden marked out.\&quot;&quot;                                                 
##  [7458] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7459] &quot;\&quot;Where is the green-house to be?\&quot;&quot;                                         
##  [7460] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7461] &quot;\&quot;Upon the knoll behind the house.  The old walnut trees are all come&quot;       
##  [7462] &quot;down to make room for it.  It will be a very fine object from many&quot;          
##  [7463] &quot;parts of the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just before&quot;        
##  [7464] &quot;it, and be exceedingly pretty.  We have cleared away all the old thorns&quot;     
##  [7465] &quot;that grew in patches over the brow.\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [7466] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7467] &quot;Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself; and was very&quot;            
##  [7468] &quot;thankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.&quot;           
##  [7469] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7470] &quot;Having now said enough to make his poverty clear, and to do away the&quot;        
##  [7471] &quot;necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters, in his&quot;     
##  [7472] &quot;next visit at Gray&#39;s his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he began&quot;     
##  [7473] &quot;to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.&quot;            
##  [7474] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7475] &quot;\&quot;She seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her house, her style of&quot;           
##  [7476] &quot;living, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an acquaintance&quot;     
##  [7477] &quot;that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may&quot;     
##  [7478] &quot;prove materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is certainly a&quot;     
##  [7479] &quot;vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks altogether so great a&quot;      
##  [7480] &quot;regard for you, that in all probability when she dies you will not be&quot;       
##  [7481] &quot;forgotten.-- She must have a great deal to leave.\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [7482] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7483] &quot;\&quot;Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has only her&quot;             
##  [7484] &quot;jointure, which will descend to her children.\&quot;&quot;                             
##  [7485] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7486] &quot;\&quot;But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income.  Few&quot;        
##  [7487] &quot;people of common prudence will do THAT; and whatever she saves, she&quot;         
##  [7488] &quot;will be able to dispose of.\&quot;&quot;                                               
##  [7489] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7490] &quot;\&quot;And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her&quot;       
##  [7491] &quot;daughters, than to us?\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [7492] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7493] &quot;\&quot;Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I&quot;          
##  [7494] &quot;cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther.&quot;              
##  [7495] &quot;Whereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, and&quot;            
##  [7496] &quot;treating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on&quot;      
##  [7497] &quot;her future consideration, which a conscientious woman would not&quot;             
##  [7498] &quot;disregard.  Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour; and she can&quot;           
##  [7499] &quot;hardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises.\&quot;&quot;     
##  [7500] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7501] &quot;\&quot;But she raises none in those most concerned.  Indeed, brother, your&quot;       
##  [7502] &quot;anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far.\&quot;&quot;               
##  [7503] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7504] &quot;\&quot;Why, to be sure,\&quot; said he, seeming to recollect himself, \&quot;people have&quot;   
##  [7505] &quot;little, have very little in their power.  But, my dear Elinor, what is&quot;      
##  [7506] &quot;the matter with Marianne?-- she looks very unwell, has lost her colour,&quot;     
##  [7507] &quot;and is grown quite thin.  Is she ill?\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [7508] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7509] &quot;\&quot;She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several&quot;       
##  [7510] &quot;weeks.\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
##  [7511] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7512] &quot;\&quot;I am sorry for that.  At her time of life, any thing of an illness&quot;        
##  [7513] &quot;destroys the bloom for ever!  Hers has been a very short one!  She was&quot;      
##  [7514] &quot;as handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to&quot;          
##  [7515] &quot;attract the man.  There was something in her style of beauty, to please&quot;     
##  [7516] &quot;them particularly.  I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry&quot;       
##  [7517] &quot;sooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly fond of&quot;     
##  [7518] &quot;YOU, but so it happened to strike her.  She will be mistaken, however.&quot;      
##  [7519] &quot;I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth more than five&quot;      
##  [7520] &quot;or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if&quot;        
##  [7521] &quot;YOU do not do better.  Dorsetshire!  I know very little of Dorsetshire;&quot;     
##  [7522] &quot;but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;&quot;        
##  [7523] &quot;and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the&quot;         
##  [7524] &quot;earliest and best pleased of your visitors.\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [7525] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7526] &quot;Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no&quot;               
##  [7527] &quot;likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation&quot;       
##  [7528] &quot;of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really&quot;       
##  [7529] &quot;resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the&quot;      
##  [7530] &quot;marriage by every possible attention.  He had just compunction enough&quot;       
##  [7531] &quot;for having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly&quot;          
##  [7532] &quot;anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from&quot;       
##  [7533] &quot;Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means&quot;      
##  [7534] &quot;of atoning for his own neglect.&quot;                                             
##  [7535] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7536] &quot;They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John&quot;         
##  [7537] &quot;came in before their visit ended.  Abundance of civilities passed on&quot;        
##  [7538] &quot;all sides.  Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood&quot;     
##  [7539] &quot;did not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very&quot;      
##  [7540] &quot;good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his&quot;      
##  [7541] &quot;appearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood&quot;         
##  [7542] &quot;went away delighted with both.&quot;                                              
##  [7543] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7544] &quot;\&quot;I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny,\&quot; said he, as he&quot;       
##  [7545] &quot;walked back with his sister.  \&quot;Lady Middleton is really a most elegant&quot;     
##  [7546] &quot;woman!  Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know.  And Mrs.&quot;     
##  [7547] &quot;Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegant&quot;      
##  [7548] &quot;as her daughter.  Your sister need not have any scruple even of&quot;             
##  [7549] &quot;visiting HER, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, and&quot;      
##  [7550] &quot;very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a&quot;      
##  [7551] &quot;man who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars&quot;      
##  [7552] &quot;were both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her daughters&quot;         
##  [7553] &quot;were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with.  But now&quot;     
##  [7554] &quot;I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both.\&quot;&quot;                      
##  [7555] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7556] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7557] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7558] &quot;CHAPTER 34&quot;                                                                  
##  [7559] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7560] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7561] &quot;Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband&#39;s judgment,&quot;        
##  [7562] &quot;that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her&quot;             
##  [7563] &quot;daughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,&quot;       
##  [7564] &quot;even the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means unworthy&quot;     
##  [7565] &quot;her notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of the most&quot;        
##  [7566] &quot;charming women in the world!&quot;                                                
##  [7567] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7568] &quot;Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood.  There was a&quot;         
##  [7569] &quot;kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually&quot;              
##  [7570] &quot;attracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid&quot;          
##  [7571] &quot;propriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding.&quot;                 
##  [7572] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7573] &quot;The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the&quot;      
##  [7574] &quot;good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings,&quot;     
##  [7575] &quot;and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking woman&quot;      
##  [7576] &quot;of uncordial address, who met her husband&#39;s sisters without any&quot;             
##  [7577] &quot;affection, and almost without having anything to say to them; for of&quot;        
##  [7578] &quot;the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she sat at least&quot;        
##  [7579] &quot;seven minutes and a half in silence.&quot;                                        
##  [7580] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7581] &quot;Elinor wanted very much to know, though she did not chuse to ask,&quot;           
##  [7582] &quot;whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny&quot;       
##  [7583] &quot;voluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that&quot;      
##  [7584] &quot;his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband&#39;s&quot;        
##  [7585] &quot;expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed&quot;         
##  [7586] &quot;them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be&quot;      
##  [7587] &quot;too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.  The&quot;             
##  [7588] &quot;intelligence however, which SHE would not give, soon flowed from&quot;            
##  [7589] &quot;another quarter.  Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor&#39;s compassion&quot;       
##  [7590] &quot;on being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr.&quot;       
##  [7591] &quot;and Mrs. Dashwood.  He dared not come to Bartlett&#39;s Buildings for fear&quot;      
##  [7592] &quot;of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to be&quot;     
##  [7593] &quot;told, they could do nothing at present but write.&quot;                           
##  [7594] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7595] &quot;Edward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short&quot;       
##  [7596] &quot;time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street.  Twice was his card found on&quot;     
##  [7597] &quot;the table, when they returned from their morning&#39;s engagements.  Elinor&quot;     
##  [7598] &quot;was pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had&quot;         
##  [7599] &quot;missed him.&quot;                                                                 
##  [7600] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7601] &quot;The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons, that,&quot;     
##  [7602] &quot;though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined to&quot;         
##  [7603] &quot;give them--a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began, invited&quot;       
##  [7604] &quot;them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very good house&quot;       
##  [7605] &quot;for three months.  Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited&quot;             
##  [7606] &quot;likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who,&quot;     
##  [7607] &quot;always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager&quot;         
##  [7608] &quot;civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.  They were to&quot;        
##  [7609] &quot;meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to&quot;      
##  [7610] &quot;be of the party.  The expectation of seeing HER, however, was enough to&quot;     
##  [7611] &quot;make her interested in the engagement; for though she could now meet&quot;        
##  [7612] &quot;Edward&#39;s mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to&quot;      
##  [7613] &quot;attend such an introduction, though she could now see her with perfect&quot;      
##  [7614] &quot;indifference as to her opinion of herself, her desire of being in&quot;           
##  [7615] &quot;company with Mrs. Ferrars, her curiosity to know what she was like, was&quot;     
##  [7616] &quot;as lively as ever.&quot;                                                          
##  [7617] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7618] &quot;The interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon&quot;            
##  [7619] &quot;afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing&quot;       
##  [7620] &quot;that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.&quot;                                
##  [7621] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7622] &quot;So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so agreeable&quot;     
##  [7623] &quot;had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was certainly&quot;      
##  [7624] &quot;not so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as ready as&quot;        
##  [7625] &quot;Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street; and it&quot;       
##  [7626] &quot;happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, as soon as&quot;      
##  [7627] &quot;the Dashwoods&#39; invitation was known, that their visit should begin a&quot;        
##  [7628] &quot;few days before the party took place.&quot;                                       
##  [7629] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7630] &quot;Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of the&quot;      
##  [7631] &quot;gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother, might not&quot;     
##  [7632] &quot;have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her table; but&quot;     
##  [7633] &quot;as Lady Middleton&#39;s guests they must be welcome; and Lucy, who had long&quot;     
##  [7634] &quot;wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a nearer view of&quot;       
##  [7635] &quot;their characters and her own difficulties, and to have an opportunity&quot;       
##  [7636] &quot;of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier in her life,&quot;        
##  [7637] &quot;than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood&#39;s card.&quot;                        
##  [7638] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7639] &quot;On Elinor its effect was very different.  She began immediately to&quot;          
##  [7640] &quot;determine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as his&quot;      
##  [7641] &quot;mother was, to a party given by his sister; and to see him for the&quot;          
##  [7642] &quot;first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardly&quot;      
##  [7643] &quot;knew how she could bear it!&quot;                                                 
##  [7644] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7645] &quot;These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and&quot;      
##  [7646] &quot;certainly not at all on truth.  They were relieved however, not by her&quot;      
##  [7647] &quot;own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to&quot;     
##  [7648] &quot;be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward&quot;         
##  [7649] &quot;certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to&quot;       
##  [7650] &quot;be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept&quot;       
##  [7651] &quot;away by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal&quot;       
##  [7652] &quot;when they were together.&quot;                                                    
##  [7653] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7654] &quot;The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies&quot;       
##  [7655] &quot;to this formidable mother-in-law.&quot;                                           
##  [7656] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7657] &quot;\&quot;Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!\&quot; said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs&quot;    
##  [7658] &quot;together--for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings,&quot;       
##  [7659] &quot;that they all followed the servant at the same time--\&quot;There is nobody&quot;      
##  [7660] &quot;here but you, that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand.&quot;          
##  [7661] &quot;Good gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all my&quot;              
##  [7662] &quot;happiness depends on--that is to be my mother!\&quot;--&quot;                          
##  [7663] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7664] &quot;Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the&quot;              
##  [7665] &quot;possibility of its being Miss Morton&#39;s mother, rather than her own,&quot;         
##  [7666] &quot;whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured&quot;      
##  [7667] &quot;her, and with great sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter&quot;          
##  [7668] &quot;amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at&quot;       
##  [7669] &quot;least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.&quot;                      
##  [7670] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7671] &quot;Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in&quot;       
##  [7672] &quot;her figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect.  Her&quot;              
##  [7673] &quot;complexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, and&quot;          
##  [7674] &quot;naturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had&quot;       
##  [7675] &quot;rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it&quot;       
##  [7676] &quot;the strong characters of pride and ill nature.  She was not a woman of&quot;      
##  [7677] &quot;many words; for, unlike people in general, she proportioned them to the&quot;     
##  [7678] &quot;number of her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her, not&quot;      
##  [7679] &quot;one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed with the spirited&quot;     
##  [7680] &quot;determination of disliking her at all events.&quot;                               
##  [7681] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7682] &quot;Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.-- A few months&quot;      
##  [7683] &quot;ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars&#39;&quot;     
##  [7684] &quot;power to distress her by it now;--and the difference of her manners to&quot;      
##  [7685] &quot;the Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made to humble&quot;        
##  [7686] &quot;her more, only amused her.  She could not but smile to see the&quot;              
##  [7687] &quot;graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person-- for&quot;      
##  [7688] &quot;Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others, had they known&quot;     
##  [7689] &quot;as much as she did, they would have been most anxious to mortify; while&quot;     
##  [7690] &quot;she herself, who had comparatively no power to wound them, sat&quot;              
##  [7691] &quot;pointedly slighted by both.  But while she smiled at a graciousness so&quot;      
##  [7692] &quot;misapplied, she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which&quot;     
##  [7693] &quot;it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss&quot;           
##  [7694] &quot;Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly despising them all&quot;      
##  [7695] &quot;four.&quot;                                                                       
##  [7696] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7697] &quot;Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss&quot;       
##  [7698] &quot;Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy.&quot;     
##  [7699] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7700] &quot;The dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every thing&quot;     
##  [7701] &quot;bespoke the Mistress&#39;s inclination for show, and the Master&#39;s ability&quot;       
##  [7702] &quot;to support it.  In spite of the improvements and additions which were&quot;       
##  [7703] &quot;making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner having once&quot;         
##  [7704] &quot;been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a&quot;          
##  [7705] &quot;loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to&quot;      
##  [7706] &quot;infer from it;--no poverty of any kind, except of conversation,&quot;             
##  [7707] &quot;appeared--but there, the deficiency was considerable.  John Dashwood&quot;        
##  [7708] &quot;had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing, and his wife&quot;        
##  [7709] &quot;had still less.  But there was no peculiar disgrace in this; for it was&quot;     
##  [7710] &quot;very much the case with the chief of their visitors, who almost all&quot;         
##  [7711] &quot;laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being&quot;            
##  [7712] &quot;agreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want of&quot;               
##  [7713] &quot;elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.&quot;                               
##  [7714] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7715] &quot;When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this poverty&quot;     
##  [7716] &quot;was particularly evident, for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse&quot;      
##  [7717] &quot;with some variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land, and&quot;             
##  [7718] &quot;breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one subject only engaged&quot;     
##  [7719] &quot;the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative heights of&quot;        
##  [7720] &quot;Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton&#39;s second son William, who were&quot;           
##  [7721] &quot;nearly of the same age.&quot;                                                     
##  [7722] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7723] &quot;Had both the children been there, the affair might have been determined&quot;     
##  [7724] &quot;too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was present, it&quot;     
##  [7725] &quot;was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every body had a right&quot;     
##  [7726] &quot;to be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it over and over&quot;     
##  [7727] &quot;again as often as they liked.&quot;                                               
##  [7728] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7729] &quot;The parties stood thus:&quot;                                                     
##  [7730] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7731] &quot;The two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was the&quot;      
##  [7732] &quot;tallest, politely decided in favour of the other.&quot;                           
##  [7733] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7734] &quot;The two grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity,&quot;         
##  [7735] &quot;were equally earnest in support of their own descendant.&quot;                    
##  [7736] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7737] &quot;Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other,&quot;      
##  [7738] &quot;thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could not&quot;     
##  [7739] &quot;conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world&quot;           
##  [7740] &quot;between them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as&quot;         
##  [7741] &quot;fast as she could, in favour of each.&quot;                                       
##  [7742] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7743] &quot;Elinor, having once delivered her opinion on William&#39;s side, by which&quot;       
##  [7744] &quot;she offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the&quot;             
##  [7745] &quot;necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when&quot;      
##  [7746] &quot;called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she had no&quot;         
##  [7747] &quot;opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.&quot;                         
##  [7748] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7749] &quot;Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair&quot;     
##  [7750] &quot;of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted and&quot;          
##  [7751] &quot;brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens,&quot;       
##  [7752] &quot;catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen&quot;      
##  [7753] &quot;into the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for&quot;        
##  [7754] &quot;his admiration.&quot;                                                             
##  [7755] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7756] &quot;\&quot;These are done by my eldest sister,\&quot; said he; \&quot;and you, as a man of&quot;     
##  [7757] &quot;taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them.  I do not know whether&quot;       
##  [7758] &quot;you have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but she&quot;       
##  [7759] &quot;is in general reckoned to draw extremely well.\&quot;&quot;                            
##  [7760] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7761] &quot;The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,&quot;         
##  [7762] &quot;warmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by&quot;      
##  [7763] &quot;Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course&quot;           
##  [7764] &quot;excited, they were handed round for general inspection.  Mrs. Ferrars,&quot;      
##  [7765] &quot;not aware of their being Elinor&#39;s work, particularly requested to look&quot;      
##  [7766] &quot;at them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady&quot;           
##  [7767] &quot;Middletons&#39;s approbation, Fanny presented them to her mother,&quot;               
##  [7768] &quot;considerately informing her, at the same time, that they were done by&quot;       
##  [7769] &quot;Miss Dashwood.&quot;                                                              
##  [7770] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7771] &quot;\&quot;Hum\&quot;--said Mrs. Ferrars--\&quot;very pretty,\&quot;--and without regarding them at&quot; 
##  [7772] &quot;all, returned them to her daughter.&quot;                                         
##  [7773] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7774] &quot;Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude&quot;      
##  [7775] &quot;enough,--for, colouring a little, she immediately said,&quot;                     
##  [7776] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7777] &quot;\&quot;They are very pretty, ma&#39;am--an&#39;t they?\&quot; But then again, the dread of&quot;    
##  [7778] &quot;having been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over her,&quot;     
##  [7779] &quot;for she presently added,&quot;                                                    
##  [7780] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7781] &quot;\&quot;Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton&#39;s style of&quot;             
##  [7782] &quot;painting, Ma&#39;am?--She DOES paint most delightfully!--How beautifully&quot;        
##  [7783] &quot;her last landscape is done!\&quot;&quot;                                               
##  [7784] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7785] &quot;\&quot;Beautifully indeed!  But SHE does every thing well.\&quot;&quot;                     
##  [7786] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7787] &quot;Marianne could not bear this.--She was already greatly displeased with&quot;      
##  [7788] &quot;Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor&#39;s&quot;             
##  [7789] &quot;expense, though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by&quot;     
##  [7790] &quot;it, provoked her immediately to say with warmth,&quot;                            
##  [7791] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7792] &quot;\&quot;This is admiration of a very particular kind!--what is Miss Morton to&quot;     
##  [7793] &quot;us?--who knows, or who cares, for her?--it is Elinor of whom WE think&quot;       
##  [7794] &quot;and speak.\&quot;&quot;                                                                
##  [7795] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7796] &quot;And so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law&#39;s hands,&quot;       
##  [7797] &quot;to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.&quot;                         
##  [7798] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7799] &quot;Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more&quot;          
##  [7800] &quot;stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, \&quot;Miss&quot;       
##  [7801] &quot;Morton is Lord Morton&#39;s daughter.\&quot;&quot;                                         
##  [7802] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7803] &quot;Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at his&quot;     
##  [7804] &quot;sister&#39;s audacity.  Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne&#39;s warmth than&quot;     
##  [7805] &quot;she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon&#39;s eyes, as they&quot;       
##  [7806] &quot;were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was amiable&quot;      
##  [7807] &quot;in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister&quot;          
##  [7808] &quot;slighted in the smallest point.&quot;                                             
##  [7809] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7810] &quot;Marianne&#39;s feelings did not stop here.  The cold insolence of Mrs.&quot;          
##  [7811] &quot;Ferrars&#39;s general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell&quot;      
##  [7812] &quot;such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart&quot;        
##  [7813] &quot;taught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of&quot;        
##  [7814] &quot;affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister&#39;s&quot;         
##  [7815] &quot;chair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to hers,&quot;     
##  [7816] &quot;said in a low, but eager, voice,&quot;                                            
##  [7817] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7818] &quot;\&quot;Dear, dear Elinor, don&#39;t mind them.  Don&#39;t let them make YOU unhappy.\&quot;&quot;   
##  [7819] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7820] &quot;She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her&quot;      
##  [7821] &quot;face on Elinor&#39;s shoulder, she burst into tears.  Every body&#39;s&quot;              
##  [7822] &quot;attention was called, and almost every body was concerned.--Colonel&quot;         
##  [7823] &quot;Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did.--Mrs.&quot;         
##  [7824] &quot;Jennings, with a very intelligent \&quot;Ah! poor dear,\&quot; immediately gave her&quot;   
##  [7825] &quot;her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author&quot;      
##  [7826] &quot;of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to one&quot;         
##  [7827] &quot;close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of&quot;        
##  [7828] &quot;the whole shocking affair.&quot;                                                  
##  [7829] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7830] &quot;In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end&quot;      
##  [7831] &quot;to the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits retained&quot;     
##  [7832] &quot;the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.&quot;                       
##  [7833] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7834] &quot;\&quot;Poor Marianne!\&quot; said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,&quot;     
##  [7835] &quot;as soon as he could secure his attention,-- \&quot;She has not such good&quot;         
##  [7836] &quot;health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor&#39;s&quot;           
##  [7837] &quot;constitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying&quot;       
##  [7838] &quot;to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal&quot;          
##  [7839] &quot;attractions.  You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS&quot;              
##  [7840] &quot;remarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.--&quot;        
##  [7841] &quot;Now you see it is all gone.\&quot;&quot;

##  [7848] &quot;Elinor&#39;s curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.-- She had found&quot;       
##  [7849] &quot;in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between&quot;     
##  [7850] &quot;the families undesirable.-- She had seen enough of her pride, her&quot;           
##  [7851] &quot;meanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend&quot;       
##  [7852] &quot;all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and&quot;           
##  [7853] &quot;retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise&quot;         
##  [7854] &quot;free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake,&quot;      
##  [7855] &quot;that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other&quot;      
##  [7856] &quot;of Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s creation, preserved her from all dependence upon her&quot;      
##  [7857] &quot;caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion.  Or at least, if she&quot;       
##  [7858] &quot;did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward&#39;s being fettered to&quot;        
##  [7859] &quot;Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she OUGHT to&quot;         
##  [7860] &quot;have rejoiced.&quot;                                                              
##  [7861] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7862] &quot;She wondered that Lucy&#39;s spirits could be so very much elevated by the&quot;      
##  [7863] &quot;civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so&quot;       
##  [7864] &quot;very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her&quot;     
##  [7865] &quot;because she was NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself--or to allow&quot;     
##  [7866] &quot;her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her, because&quot;       
##  [7867] &quot;her real situation was unknown.  But that it was so, had not only been&quot;      
##  [7868] &quot;declared by Lucy&#39;s eyes at the time, but was declared over again the&quot;        
##  [7869] &quot;next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady Middleton&quot;      
##  [7870] &quot;set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone,&quot;       
##  [7871] &quot;to tell her how happy she was.&quot;                                              
##  [7872] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7873] &quot;The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon&quot;          
##  [7874] &quot;after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.&quot;                              
##  [7875] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7876] &quot;\&quot;My dear friend,\&quot; cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, \&quot;I&quot;     
##  [7877] &quot;come to talk to you of my happiness.  Could anything be so flattering&quot;       
##  [7878] &quot;as Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s way of treating me yesterday?  So exceeding affable&quot;       
##  [7879] &quot;as she was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;--but&quot;        
##  [7880] &quot;the very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her&quot;       
##  [7881] &quot;behaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy to&quot;       
##  [7882] &quot;me.  Now was not it so?-- You saw it all; and was not you quite struck&quot;      
##  [7883] &quot;with it?\&quot;&quot;                                                                  
##  [7884] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7885] &quot;\&quot;She was certainly very civil to you.\&quot;&quot;                                    
##  [7886] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7887] &quot;\&quot;Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?-- I saw a vast deal&quot;        
##  [7888] &quot;more.  Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride,&quot;      
##  [7889] &quot;no hauteur, and your sister just the same--all sweetness and&quot;                
##  [7890] &quot;affability!\&quot;&quot;                                                               
##  [7891] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7892] &quot;Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her to&quot;      
##  [7893] &quot;own that she had reason for her happiness; and Elinor was obliged to go&quot;     
##  [7894] &quot;on.--&quot;                                                                       
##  [7895] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7896] &quot;\&quot;Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,\&quot; said she, \&quot;nothing&quot;     
##  [7897] &quot;could be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was&quot;      
##  [7898] &quot;not the case\&quot;--&quot;                                                            
##  [7899] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7900] &quot;\&quot;I guessed you would say so,\&quot;--replied Lucy quickly--\&quot;but there was no&quot;   
##  [7901] &quot;reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she did&quot;     
##  [7902] &quot;not, and her liking me is every thing.  You shan&#39;t talk me out of my&quot;        
##  [7903] &quot;satisfaction.  I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no&quot;         
##  [7904] &quot;difficulties at all, to what I used to think.  Mrs. Ferrars is a&quot;            
##  [7905] &quot;charming woman, and so is your sister.  They are both delightful women,&quot;     
##  [7906] &quot;indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs.&quot;            
##  [7907] &quot;Dashwood was!\&quot;&quot;                                                             
##  [7908] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7909] &quot;To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.&quot;              
##  [7910] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7911] &quot;\&quot;Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you seem low--you don&#39;t speak;--sure you&quot;     
##  [7912] &quot;an&#39;t well.\&quot;&quot;                                                                
##  [7913] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7914] &quot;\&quot;I never was in better health.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [7915] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7916] &quot;\&quot;I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it.  I&quot;     
##  [7917] &quot;should be sorry to have YOU ill; you, that have been the greatest&quot;           
##  [7918] &quot;comfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have done&quot;           
##  [7919] &quot;without your friendship.\&quot;--&quot;                                                
##  [7920] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7921] &quot;Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success.&quot;       
##  [7922] &quot;But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she directly replied,&quot;                    
##  [7923] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7924] &quot;\&quot;Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to&quot;        
##  [7925] &quot;Edward&#39;s love, it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But&quot;        
##  [7926] &quot;now there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty&quot;      
##  [7927] &quot;often, for Lady Middleton&#39;s delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall&quot;       
##  [7928] &quot;be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half his&quot;     
##  [7929] &quot;time with his sister--besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will&quot;         
##  [7930] &quot;visit now;--and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say&quot;       
##  [7931] &quot;more than once, they should always be glad to see me.-- They are such&quot;       
##  [7932] &quot;charming women!--I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of&quot;     
##  [7933] &quot;her, you cannot speak too high.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [7934] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7935] &quot;But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she SHOULD&quot;     
##  [7936] &quot;tell her sister.  Lucy continued.&quot;                                           
##  [7937] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7938] &quot;\&quot;I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had took&quot;     
##  [7939] &quot;a dislike to me.  If she had only made me a formal courtesy, for&quot;            
##  [7940] &quot;instance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice of&quot;     
##  [7941] &quot;me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know what I mean--if&quot;      
##  [7942] &quot;I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should have gave&quot;       
##  [7943] &quot;it all up in despair.  I could not have stood it.  For where she DOES&quot;       
##  [7944] &quot;dislike, I know it is most violent.\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [7945] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7946] &quot;Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by&quot;        
##  [7947] &quot;the door&#39;s being thrown open, the servant&#39;s announcing Mr. Ferrars, and&quot;     
##  [7948] &quot;Edward&#39;s immediately walking in.&quot;                                            
##  [7949] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7950] &quot;It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each shewed that&quot;       
##  [7951] &quot;it was so.  They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed to&quot;       
##  [7952] &quot;have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to&quot;           
##  [7953] &quot;advance farther into it.  The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest&quot;       
##  [7954] &quot;form, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had fallen&quot;     
##  [7955] &quot;on them.--They were not only all three together, but were together&quot;          
##  [7956] &quot;without the relief of any other person.  The ladies recovered&quot;               
##  [7957] &quot;themselves first.  It was not Lucy&#39;s business to put herself forward,&quot;       
##  [7958] &quot;and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up.  She could&quot;             
##  [7959] &quot;therefore only LOOK her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him,&quot;      
##  [7960] &quot;said no more.&quot;                                                               
##  [7961] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7962] &quot;But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and her&quot;     
##  [7963] &quot;own, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment&#39;s&quot;               
##  [7964] &quot;recollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost&quot;       
##  [7965] &quot;easy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still&quot;           
##  [7966] &quot;improved them.  She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the&quot;           
##  [7967] &quot;consciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her from&quot;          
##  [7968] &quot;saying that she was happy to see him, and that she had very much&quot;            
##  [7969] &quot;regretted being from home, when he called before in Berkeley Street.&quot;        
##  [7970] &quot;She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, as&quot;      
##  [7971] &quot;a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes of&quot;      
##  [7972] &quot;Lucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.&quot;           
##  [7973] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7974] &quot;Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage enough&quot;     
##  [7975] &quot;to sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in&quot;     
##  [7976] &quot;a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his sex might&quot;      
##  [7977] &quot;make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy&#39;s, nor&quot;         
##  [7978] &quot;could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor&#39;s.&quot;                       
##  [7979] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7980] &quot;Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no&quot;           
##  [7981] &quot;contribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word;&quot;        
##  [7982] &quot;and almost every thing that WAS said, proceeded from Elinor, who was&quot;        
##  [7983] &quot;obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother&#39;s health,&quot;         
##  [7984] &quot;their coming to town, &amp;c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,&quot;        
##  [7985] &quot;but never did.&quot;                                                              
##  [7986] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7987] &quot;Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herself&quot;       
##  [7988] &quot;so heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching&quot;          
##  [7989] &quot;Marianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it, and&quot;     
##  [7990] &quot;THAT in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several minutes on&quot;     
##  [7991] &quot;the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude, before she went&quot;     
##  [7992] &quot;to her sister.  When that was once done, however, it was time for the&quot;       
##  [7993] &quot;raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne&#39;s joy hurried her into the&quot;        
##  [7994] &quot;drawing-room immediately.  Her pleasure in seeing him was like every&quot;        
##  [7995] &quot;other of her feelings, strong in itself, and strongly spoken.  She met&quot;      
##  [7996] &quot;him with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed the&quot;         
##  [7997] &quot;affection of a sister.&quot;                                                      
##  [7998] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [7999] &quot;\&quot;Dear Edward!\&quot; she cried, \&quot;this is a moment of great happiness!--This&quot;    
##  [8000] &quot;would almost make amends for every thing!\&quot;&quot;                                 
##  [8001] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8002] &quot;Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such&quot;         
##  [8003] &quot;witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt.  Again they all&quot;        
##  [8004] &quot;sat down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was&quot;       
##  [8005] &quot;looking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and&quot;          
##  [8006] &quot;sometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other&quot;       
##  [8007] &quot;should be checked by Lucy&#39;s unwelcome presence.  Edward was the first&quot;       
##  [8008] &quot;to speak, and it was to notice Marianne&#39;s altered looks, and express&quot;        
##  [8009] &quot;his fear of her not finding London agree with her.&quot;                          
##  [8010] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8011] &quot;\&quot;Oh, don&#39;t think of me!\&quot; she replied with spirited earnestness, though&quot;    
##  [8012] &quot;her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, \&quot;don&#39;t think of MY&quot;           
##  [8013] &quot;health.  Elinor is well, you see.  That must be enough for us both.\&quot;&quot;       
##  [8014] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8015] &quot;This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor&quot;      
##  [8016] &quot;to conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no&quot;      
##  [8017] &quot;very benignant expression.&quot;                                                  
##  [8018] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8019] &quot;\&quot;Do you like London?\&quot; said Edward, willing to say any thing that might&quot;    
##  [8020] &quot;introduce another subject.&quot;                                                  
##  [8021] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8022] &quot;\&quot;Not at all.  I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none.&quot;       
##  [8023] &quot;The sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; and&quot;          
##  [8024] &quot;thank Heaven! you are what you always were!\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [8025] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8026] &quot;She paused--no one spoke.&quot;                                                   
##  [8027] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8028] &quot;\&quot;I think, Elinor,\&quot; she presently added, \&quot;we must employ Edward to take&quot;   
##  [8029] &quot;care of us in our return to Barton.  In a week or two, I suppose, we&quot;        
##  [8030] &quot;shall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to&quot;          
##  [8031] &quot;accept the charge.\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##  [8032] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8033] &quot;Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even&quot;      
##  [8034] &quot;himself.  But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily trace&quot;       
##  [8035] &quot;it to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied, and&quot;     
##  [8036] &quot;soon talked of something else.&quot;                                              
##  [8037] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8038] &quot;\&quot;We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday!  So dull, so&quot;     
##  [8039] &quot;wretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head, which&quot;         
##  [8040] &quot;cannot be said now.\&quot;&quot;                                                       
##  [8041] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8042] &quot;And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her&quot;       
##  [8043] &quot;finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her&quot;      
##  [8044] &quot;being particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in&quot;        
##  [8045] &quot;private.&quot;                                                                    
##  [8046] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8047] &quot;\&quot;But why were you not there, Edward?--Why did you not come?\&quot;&quot;              
##  [8048] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8049] &quot;\&quot;I was engaged elsewhere.\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [8050] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8051] &quot;\&quot;Engaged!  But what was that, when such friends were to be met?\&quot;&quot;          
##  [8052] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8053] &quot;\&quot;Perhaps, Miss Marianne,\&quot; cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on&quot;       
##  [8054] &quot;her, \&quot;you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have no&quot;    
##  [8055] &quot;mind to keep them, little as well as great.\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [8056] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8057] &quot;Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the&quot;       
##  [8058] &quot;sting; for she calmly replied,&quot;                                              
##  [8059] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8060] &quot;\&quot;Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that&quot;              
##  [8061] &quot;conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street.  And I really believe&quot;       
##  [8062] &quot;he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulous&quot;       
##  [8063] &quot;in performing every engagement, however minute, and however it may make&quot;     
##  [8064] &quot;against his interest or pleasure.  He is the most fearful of giving&quot;         
##  [8065] &quot;pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish,&quot;     
##  [8066] &quot;of any body I ever saw.  Edward, it is so, and I will say it.  What!&quot;        
##  [8067] &quot;are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you must be no friend of&quot;      
##  [8068] &quot;mine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to&quot;       
##  [8069] &quot;my open commendation.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##  [8070] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8071] &quot;The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened&quot;      
##  [8072] &quot;to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her&quot;          
##  [8073] &quot;auditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon&quot;       
##  [8074] &quot;got up to go away.&quot;                                                          
##  [8075] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8076] &quot;\&quot;Going so soon!\&quot; said Marianne; \&quot;my dear Edward, this must not be.\&quot;&quot;     
##  [8077] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8078] &quot;And drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucy&quot;      
##  [8079] &quot;could not stay much longer.  But even this encouragement failed, for he&quot;     
##  [8080] &quot;would go; and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted&quot;       
##  [8081] &quot;two hours, soon afterwards went away.&quot;                                       
##  [8082] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8083] &quot;\&quot;What can bring her here so often?\&quot; said Marianne, on her leaving them.&quot;   
##  [8084] &quot;\&quot;Could not she see that we wanted her gone!--how teazing to Edward!\&quot;&quot;      
##  [8085] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8086] &quot;\&quot;Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest known&quot;     
##  [8087] &quot;to him of any.  It is but natural that he should like to see her as&quot;         
##  [8088] &quot;well as ourselves.\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##  [8089] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8090] &quot;Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, \&quot;You know, Elinor, that this&quot;    
##  [8091] &quot;is a kind of talking which I cannot bear.  If you only hope to have&quot;         
##  [8092] &quot;your assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, you&quot;          
##  [8093] &quot;ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it.  I&quot;      
##  [8094] &quot;cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not really&quot;         
##  [8095] &quot;wanted.\&quot;&quot;                                                                   
##  [8096] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8097] &quot;She then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more,&quot;        
##  [8098] &quot;for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could give&quot;      
##  [8099] &quot;no information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the&quot;             
##  [8100] &quot;consequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she was&quot;          
##  [8101] &quot;obliged to submit to it.  All that she could hope, was that Edward&quot;          
##  [8102] &quot;would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing&quot;            
##  [8103] &quot;Marianne&#39;s mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of&quot;      
##  [8104] &quot;the pain that had attended their recent meeting--and this she had every&quot;     
##  [8105] &quot;reason to expect.&quot;                                                           
##  [8106] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8107] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8108] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8109] &quot;CHAPTER 36&quot;                                                                  
##  [8110] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8111] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8112] &quot;Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the&quot;       
##  [8113] &quot;world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a&quot;       
##  [8114] &quot;son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least&quot;       
##  [8115] &quot;to all those intimate connections who knew it before.&quot;                       
##  [8116] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8117] &quot;This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings&#39;s happiness, produced a&quot;       
##  [8118] &quot;temporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a&quot;      
##  [8119] &quot;like degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished to&quot;     
##  [8120] &quot;be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning as&quot;    
##  [8121] &quot;soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in the evening;&quot;       
##  [8122] &quot;and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the Middletons,&quot;        
##  [8123] &quot;spent the whole of every day in Conduit Street. For their own comfort&quot;       
##  [8124] &quot;they would much rather have remained, at least all the morning, in Mrs.&quot;     
##  [8125] &quot;Jennings&#39;s house; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes&quot;     
##  [8126] &quot;of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and&quot;    
##  [8127] &quot;the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact was as little&quot;          
##  [8128] &quot;valued, as it was professedly sought.&quot;                                       
##  [8129] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8130] &quot;They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and&quot;       
##  [8131] &quot;by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on&quot;      
##  [8132] &quot;THEIR ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize.&quot;     
##  [8133] &quot;Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton&#39;s behaviour to&quot;      
##  [8134] &quot;Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.  Because they&quot;     
##  [8135] &quot;neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not believe them&quot;      
##  [8136] &quot;good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she fancied them&quot;       
##  [8137] &quot;satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical;&quot;     
##  [8138] &quot;but THAT did not signify.  It was censure in common use, and easily&quot;         
##  [8139] &quot;given.&quot;                                                                      
##  [8140] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8141] &quot;Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy.  It checked the&quot;     
##  [8142] &quot;idleness of one, and the business of the other.  Lady Middleton was&quot;         
##  [8143] &quot;ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was&quot;       
##  [8144] &quot;proud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would&quot;      
##  [8145] &quot;despise her for offering.  Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the&quot;     
##  [8146] &quot;three, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her to&quot;     
##  [8147] &quot;it entirely.  Would either of them only have given her a full and&quot;           
##  [8148] &quot;minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby,&quot;     
##  [8149] &quot;she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the&quot;      
##  [8150] &quot;best place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned.&quot;        
##  [8151] &quot;But this conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw out&quot;       
##  [8152] &quot;expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt&quot;      
##  [8153] &quot;a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was&quot;     
##  [8154] &quot;produced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in&quot;      
##  [8155] &quot;the latter.  An effort even yet lighter might have made her their&quot;           
##  [8156] &quot;friend.  Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor!  But so&quot;      
##  [8157] &quot;little were they, anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her, that&quot;     
##  [8158] &quot;if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole day without&quot;            
##  [8159] &quot;hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what she was kind&quot;           
##  [8160] &quot;enough to bestow on herself.&quot;                                                
##  [8161] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8162] &quot;All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally&quot;              
##  [8163] &quot;unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing&quot;        
##  [8164] &quot;for the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her young&quot;         
##  [8165] &quot;friends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old&quot;          
##  [8166] &quot;woman so long.  She joined them sometimes at Sir John&#39;s, sometimes at&quot;       
##  [8167] &quot;her own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellent&quot;            
##  [8168] &quot;spirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte&#39;s well&quot;       
##  [8169] &quot;doing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail&quot;       
##  [8170] &quot;of her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.&quot;       
##  [8171] &quot;One thing DID disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint.&quot;        
##  [8172] &quot;Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his sex,&quot;     
##  [8173] &quot;of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly perceive, at&quot;       
##  [8174] &quot;different times, the most striking resemblance between this baby and&quot;        
##  [8175] &quot;every one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing his&quot;       
##  [8176] &quot;father of it; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like&quot;     
##  [8177] &quot;every other baby of the same age; nor could he even be brought to&quot;           
##  [8178] &quot;acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the&quot;     
##  [8179] &quot;world.&quot;                                                                      
##  [8180] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8181] &quot;I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time&quot;           
##  [8182] &quot;befell Mrs. John Dashwood.  It so happened that while her two sisters&quot;       
##  [8183] &quot;with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another&quot;      
##  [8184] &quot;of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance in itself not&quot;              
##  [8185] &quot;apparently likely to produce evil to her.  But while the imaginations&quot;       
##  [8186] &quot;of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our&quot;         
##  [8187] &quot;conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one&#39;s happiness&quot;         
##  [8188] &quot;must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.  In the present&quot;      
##  [8189] &quot;instance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun&quot;         
##  [8190] &quot;truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss&quot;          
##  [8191] &quot;Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood&#39;s sisters, she&quot;         
##  [8192] &quot;immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this&quot;         
##  [8193] &quot;misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of&quot;           
##  [8194] &quot;invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small&quot;     
##  [8195] &quot;musical party at her house.  The consequence of which was, that Mrs.&quot;        
##  [8196] &quot;John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great&quot;       
##  [8197] &quot;inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what&quot;     
##  [8198] &quot;was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing&quot;     
##  [8199] &quot;to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they might not&quot;        
##  [8200] &quot;expect to go out with her a second time?  The power of disappointing&quot;        
##  [8201] &quot;them, it was true, must always be hers.  But that was not enough; for&quot;       
##  [8202] &quot;when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be&quot;       
##  [8203] &quot;wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from&quot;        
##  [8204] &quot;them.&quot;                                                                       
##  [8205] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8206] &quot;Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of&quot;         
##  [8207] &quot;going out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to&quot;         
##  [8208] &quot;her, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and mechanically&quot;     
##  [8209] &quot;for every evening&#39;s engagement, though without expecting the smallest&quot;       
##  [8210] &quot;amusement from any, and very often without knowing, till the last&quot;           
##  [8211] &quot;moment, where it was to take her.&quot;                                           
##  [8212] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8213] &quot;To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, as&quot;      
##  [8214] &quot;not to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her&quot;         
##  [8215] &quot;toilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of&quot;     
##  [8216] &quot;their being together, when it was finished.  Nothing escaped HER minute&quot;     
##  [8217] &quot;observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and asked every&quot;     
##  [8218] &quot;thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of&quot;              
##  [8219] &quot;Marianne&#39;s dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether&quot;     
##  [8220] &quot;with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not without hopes&quot;       
##  [8221] &quot;of finding out before they parted, how much her washing cost per week,&quot;      
##  [8222] &quot;and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.  The&quot;                 
##  [8223] &quot;impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally&quot;           
##  [8224] &quot;concluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was&quot;         
##  [8225] &quot;considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after&quot;       
##  [8226] &quot;undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, the&quot;          
##  [8227] &quot;colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almost&quot;        
##  [8228] &quot;sure of being told that upon \&quot;her word she looked vastly smart, and she&quot;    
##  [8229] &quot;dared to say she would make a great many conquests.\&quot;&quot;                       
##  [8230] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8231] &quot;With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed on the present&quot;           
##  [8232] &quot;occasion, to her brother&#39;s carriage; which they were ready to enter&quot;         
##  [8233] &quot;five minutes after it stopped at the door, a punctuality not very&quot;           
##  [8234] &quot;agreeable to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house of&quot;     
##  [8235] &quot;her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay on their part&quot;         
##  [8236] &quot;that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman.&quot;                    
##  [8237] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8238] &quot;The events of this evening were not very remarkable.  The party, like&quot;       
##  [8239] &quot;other musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real&quot;        
##  [8240] &quot;taste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all;&quot;       
##  [8241] &quot;and the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,&quot;      
##  [8242] &quot;and that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in&quot;        
##  [8243] &quot;England.&quot;                                                                    
##  [8244] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8245] &quot;As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she made no&quot;          
##  [8246] &quot;scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it&quot;          
##  [8247] &quot;suited her, and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and&quot;            
##  [8248] &quot;violoncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the&quot;          
##  [8249] &quot;room.  In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of&quot;     
##  [8250] &quot;young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases&quot;     
##  [8251] &quot;at Gray&#39;s.  She perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself, and&quot;       
##  [8252] &quot;speaking familiarly to her brother; and had just determined to find out&quot;     
##  [8253] &quot;his name from the latter, when they both came towards her, and Mr.&quot;          
##  [8254] &quot;Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.&quot;                       
##  [8255] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8256] &quot;He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bow&quot;        
##  [8257] &quot;which assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he was&quot;          
##  [8258] &quot;exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy.  Happy&quot;       
##  [8259] &quot;had it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his&quot;      
##  [8260] &quot;own merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations!  For then his&quot;        
##  [8261] &quot;brother&#39;s bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the&quot;              
##  [8262] &quot;ill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun.  But while she&quot;        
##  [8263] &quot;wondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that&quot;      
##  [8264] &quot;the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out of all charity with&quot;        
##  [8265] &quot;the modesty and worth of the other.  Why they WERE different, Robert&quot;        
##  [8266] &quot;exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour&#39;s&quot;            
##  [8267] &quot;conversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme&quot;        
##  [8268] &quot;GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper&quot;           
##  [8269] &quot;society, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any&quot;          
##  [8270] &quot;natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education;&quot;          
##  [8271] &quot;while he himself, though probably without any particular, any material&quot;      
##  [8272] &quot;superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,&quot;        
##  [8273] &quot;was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.&quot;                    
##  [8274] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8275] &quot;\&quot;Upon my soul,\&quot; he added, \&quot;I believe it is nothing more; and so I often&quot;  
##  [8276] &quot;tell my mother, when she is grieving about it.  &#39;My dear Madam,&#39; I&quot;          
##  [8277] &quot;always say to her, &#39;you must make yourself easy.  The evil is now&quot;           
##  [8278] &quot;irremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing.  Why would you&quot;       
##  [8279] &quot;be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to&quot;         
##  [8280] &quot;place Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his&quot;        
##  [8281] &quot;life?  If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself,&quot;           
##  [8282] &quot;instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt&#39;s, all this would have been&quot;             
##  [8283] &quot;prevented.&#39; This is the way in which I always consider the matter, and&quot;      
##  [8284] &quot;my mother is perfectly convinced of her error.\&quot;&quot;                            
##  [8285] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8286] &quot;Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because, whatever might be her&quot;         
##  [8287] &quot;general estimation of the advantage of a public school, she could not&quot;       
##  [8288] &quot;think of Edward&#39;s abode in Mr. Pratt&#39;s family, with any satisfaction.&quot;       
##  [8289] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8290] &quot;\&quot;You reside in Devonshire, I think,\&quot;--was his next observation, \&quot;in a&quot;    
##  [8291] &quot;cottage near Dawlish.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##  [8292] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8293] &quot;Elinor set him right as to its situation; and it seemed rather&quot;              
##  [8294] &quot;surprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire, without living&quot;     
##  [8295] &quot;near Dawlish.  He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their&quot;          
##  [8296] &quot;species of house.&quot;                                                           
##  [8297] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8298] &quot;\&quot;For my own part,\&quot; said he, \&quot;I am excessively fond of a cottage; there&quot;   
##  [8299] &quot;is always so much comfort, so much elegance about them.  And I protest,&quot;     
##  [8300] &quot;if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one&quot;       
##  [8301] &quot;myself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself&quot;       
##  [8302] &quot;down at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy.  I&quot;      
##  [8303] &quot;advise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage.  My friend&quot;     
##  [8304] &quot;Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,&quot;        
##  [8305] &quot;and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi&#39;s.  I was to decide&quot;      
##  [8306] &quot;on the best of them.  &#39;My dear Courtland,&#39; said I, immediately throwing&quot;     
##  [8307] &quot;them all into the fire, &#39;do not adopt either of them, but by all means&quot;      
##  [8308] &quot;build a cottage.&#39; And that I fancy, will be the end of it.&quot;                  
##  [8309] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8310] &quot;\&quot;Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in a&quot;    
##  [8311] &quot;cottage; but this is all a mistake.  I was last month at my friend&quot;          
##  [8312] &quot;Elliott&#39;s, near Dartford.  Lady Elliott wished to give a dance.  &#39;But&quot;       
##  [8313] &quot;how can it be done?&#39; said she; &#39;my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is&quot;       
##  [8314] &quot;to be managed.  There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten&quot;      
##  [8315] &quot;couple, and where can the supper be?&#39; I immediately saw that there&quot;          
##  [8316] &quot;could be no difficulty in it, so I said, &#39;My dear Lady Elliott, do not&quot;      
##  [8317] &quot;be uneasy.  The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;&quot;        
##  [8318] &quot;card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open&quot;      
##  [8319] &quot;for tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the&quot;        
##  [8320] &quot;saloon.&#39;  Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought.  We measured the&quot;     
##  [8321] &quot;dining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the&quot;       
##  [8322] &quot;affair was arranged precisely after my plan.  So that, in fact, you&quot;         
##  [8323] &quot;see, if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be as&quot;     
##  [8324] &quot;well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling.\&quot;&quot;               
##  [8325] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8326] &quot;Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the&quot;              
##  [8327] &quot;compliment of rational opposition.&quot;                                          
##  [8328] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8329] &quot;As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister,&quot;      
##  [8330] &quot;his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else; and a thought&quot;     
##  [8331] &quot;struck him during the evening, which he communicated to his wife, for&quot;       
##  [8332] &quot;her approbation, when they got home.  The consideration of Mrs.&quot;             
##  [8333] &quot;Dennison&#39;s mistake, in supposing his sisters their guests, had&quot;              
##  [8334] &quot;suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such,&quot;       
##  [8335] &quot;while Mrs. Jennings&#39;s engagements kept her from home.  The expense would&quot;    
##  [8336] &quot;be nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether an&quot;            
##  [8337] &quot;attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be&quot;            
##  [8338] &quot;requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his&quot;           
##  [8339] &quot;father.  Fanny was startled at the proposal.&quot;                                
##  [8340] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8341] &quot;\&quot;I do not see how it can be done,\&quot; said she, \&quot;without affronting Lady&quot;    
##  [8342] &quot;Middleton, for they spend every day with her; otherwise I should be&quot;         
##  [8343] &quot;exceedingly glad to do it.  You know I am always ready to pay them any&quot;      
##  [8344] &quot;attention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shews.  But&quot;       
##  [8345] &quot;they are Lady Middleton&#39;s visitors.  How can I ask them away from her?\&quot;&quot;    
##  [8346] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8347] &quot;Her husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her&quot;          
##  [8348] &quot;objection.  \&quot;They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit&quot;       
##  [8349] &quot;Street, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the&quot;      
##  [8350] &quot;same number of days to such near relations.\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [8351] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8352] &quot;Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,&quot;                    
##  [8353] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8354] &quot;\&quot;My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power.&quot;        
##  [8355] &quot;But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a&quot;     
##  [8356] &quot;few days with us.  They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and&quot;      
##  [8357] &quot;I think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very well&quot;       
##  [8358] &quot;by Edward.  We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but the&quot;      
##  [8359] &quot;Miss Steeles may not be in town any more.  I am sure you will like&quot;          
##  [8360] &quot;them; indeed, you DO like them, you know, very much already, and so&quot;         
##  [8361] &quot;does my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!\&quot;&quot;                  
##  [8362] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8363] &quot;Mr. Dashwood was convinced.  He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss&quot;      
##  [8364] &quot;Steeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution&quot;      
##  [8365] &quot;of inviting his sisters another year; at the same time, however, slyly&quot;      
##  [8366] &quot;suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by&quot;         
##  [8367] &quot;bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon&#39;s wife, and Marianne as&quot;          
##  [8368] &quot;THEIR visitor.&quot;                                                              
##  [8369] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8370] &quot;Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready wit that had&quot;         
##  [8371] &quot;procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to request her company and&quot;     
##  [8372] &quot;her sister&#39;s, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as Lady&quot;              
##  [8373] &quot;Middleton could spare them.  This was enough to make Lucy really and&quot;        
##  [8374] &quot;reasonably happy.  Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her,&quot;           
##  [8375] &quot;herself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!  Such&quot;       
##  [8376] &quot;an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all&quot;           
##  [8377] &quot;things, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation the&quot;       
##  [8378] &quot;most gratifying to her feelings!  It was an advantage that could not be&quot;     
##  [8379] &quot;too gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the&quot;          
##  [8380] &quot;visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits,&quot;       
##  [8381] &quot;was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days&#39;&quot;      
##  [8382] &quot;time.&quot;                                                                       
##  [8383] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8384] &quot;When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after&quot;       
##  [8385] &quot;its arrival, it gave her, for the first time, some share in the&quot;             
##  [8386] &quot;expectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed&quot;      
##  [8387] &quot;on so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will&quot;           
##  [8388] &quot;towards her arose from something more than merely malice against&quot;            
##  [8389] &quot;herself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing&quot;       
##  [8390] &quot;that Lucy wished.  Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady&quot;       
##  [8391] &quot;Middleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John&quot;              
##  [8392] &quot;Dashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability of&quot;          
##  [8393] &quot;greater.&quot;                                                                    
##  [8394] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8395] &quot;The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor&quot;      
##  [8396] &quot;of their influence there, strengthened her expectation of the event.&quot;        
##  [8397] &quot;Sir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such accounts&quot;     
##  [8398] &quot;of the favour they were in, as must be universally striking.  Mrs.&quot;          
##  [8399] &quot;Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her&quot;         
##  [8400] &quot;life, as she was with them; had given each of them a needle book made&quot;       
##  [8401] &quot;by some emigrant; called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not know&quot;       
##  [8402] &quot;whether she should ever be able to part with them.&quot;                          
##  [8403] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8404] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8405] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8406] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8407] &quot;&quot;

##  [8416] &quot;Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her mother felt&quot;     
##  [8417] &quot;it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her; and,&quot;        
##  [8418] &quot;contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day, returned from&quot;     
##  [8419] &quot;that period to her own home, and her own habits, in which she found the&quot;     
##  [8420] &quot;Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share.&quot;                     
##  [8421] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8422] &quot;About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in&quot;       
##  [8423] &quot;Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her ordinary visit to&quot;     
##  [8424] &quot;Mrs. Palmer, entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting by&quot;          
##  [8425] &quot;herself, with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to&quot;         
##  [8426] &quot;hear something wonderful; and giving her time only to form that idea,&quot;       
##  [8427] &quot;began directly to justify it, by saying,&quot;                                    
##  [8428] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8429] &quot;\&quot;Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?\&quot;&quot;                   
##  [8430] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8431] &quot;\&quot;No, ma&#39;am.  What is it?\&quot;&quot;                                                 
##  [8432] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8433] &quot;\&quot;Something so strange!  But you shall hear it all.-- When I got to Mr.&quot;     
##  [8434] &quot;Palmer&#39;s, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child.  She was&quot;       
##  [8435] &quot;sure it was very ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.&quot;      
##  [8436] &quot;So I looked at it directly, and, &#39;Lord! my dear,&#39; says I, &#39;it is&quot;            
##  [8437] &quot;nothing in the world, but the red gum--&#39; and nurse said just the same.&quot;      
##  [8438] &quot;But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for;&quot;     
##  [8439] &quot;and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he&quot;           
##  [8440] &quot;stepped over directly, and as soon as ever Mama, he said&quot;                    
##  [8441] &quot;just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and&quot;       
##  [8442] &quot;then Charlotte was easy.  And so, just as he was going away again, it&quot;       
##  [8443] &quot;came into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of&quot;       
##  [8444] &quot;it, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news.  So upon&quot;     
##  [8445] &quot;that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know&quot;        
##  [8446] &quot;something or other, and at last he said in a whisper, &#39;For fear any&quot;         
##  [8447] &quot;unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to&quot;       
##  [8448] &quot;their sister&#39;s indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I&quot;           
##  [8449] &quot;believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will&quot;       
##  [8450] &quot;do very well.&#39;\&quot;&quot;                                                            
##  [8451] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8452] &quot;\&quot;What! is Fanny ill?\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##  [8453] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8454] &quot;\&quot;That is exactly what I said, my dear.  &#39;Lord!&#39; says I, &#39;is Mrs.&quot;           
##  [8455] &quot;Dashwood ill?&#39; So then it all came out; and the long and the short of&quot;       
##  [8456] &quot;the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this.  Mr. Edward Ferrars,&quot;      
##  [8457] &quot;the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it&quot;        
##  [8458] &quot;turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr.&quot;        
##  [8459] &quot;Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my&quot;     
##  [8460] &quot;cousin Lucy!--There&#39;s for you, my dear!--And not a creature knowing a&quot;       
##  [8461] &quot;syllable of the matter, except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a&quot;       
##  [8462] &quot;thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another;&quot;     
##  [8463] &quot;but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody&quot;      
##  [8464] &quot;suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together,&quot;       
##  [8465] &quot;or I am sure I should have found it out directly.  Well, and so this&quot;        
##  [8466] &quot;was kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor&quot;      
##  [8467] &quot;your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--till this very&quot;      
##  [8468] &quot;morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no&quot;      
##  [8469] &quot;conjurer, popt it all out.  &#39;Lord!&#39; thinks she to herself, &#39;they are&quot;        
##  [8470] &quot;all so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;&#39;&quot;     
##  [8471] &quot;and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her&quot;      
##  [8472] &quot;carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come--for she had just been&quot;      
##  [8473] &quot;saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought to&quot;       
##  [8474] &quot;make a match between Edward and some Lord&#39;s daughter or other, I forget&quot;     
##  [8475] &quot;who.  So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride.&quot;      
##  [8476] &quot;She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as&quot;           
##  [8477] &quot;reached your brother&#39;s ears, as he was sitting in his own dressing-room&quot;     
##  [8478] &quot;down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the&quot;          
##  [8479] &quot;country.  So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for&quot;      
##  [8480] &quot;Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on.&quot;      
##  [8481] &quot;Poor soul!  I pity HER.  And I must say, I think she was used very&quot;          
##  [8482] &quot;hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her into&quot;      
##  [8483] &quot;a fainting fit.  Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly;&quot;        
##  [8484] &quot;and your brother, he walked about the room, and said he did not know&quot;        
##  [8485] &quot;what to do.  Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute&quot;           
##  [8486] &quot;longer in the house, and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS&quot;        
##  [8487] &quot;knees too, to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up&quot;         
##  [8488] &quot;their clothes.  THEN she fell into hysterics again, and he was so&quot;           
##  [8489] &quot;frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found&quot;        
##  [8490] &quot;the house in all this uproar.  The carriage was at the door ready to&quot;        
##  [8491] &quot;take my poor cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he came&quot;        
##  [8492] &quot;off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says, she could hardly walk; and&quot;     
##  [8493] &quot;Nancy, she was almost as bad.  I declare, I have no patience with your&quot;      
##  [8494] &quot;sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of&quot;       
##  [8495] &quot;her.  Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of&quot;       
##  [8496] &quot;it!  To have his love used so scornfully! for they say he is monstrous&quot;      
##  [8497] &quot;fond of her, as well he may.  I should not wonder, if he was to be in&quot;       
##  [8498] &quot;the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.  He and I&quot;      
##  [8499] &quot;had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he is&quot;       
##  [8500] &quot;gone back again to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs.&quot;      
##  [8501] &quot;Ferrars is told of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins&quot;      
##  [8502] &quot;left the house, for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too;&quot;     
##  [8503] &quot;and so she may, for what I care.  I have no pity for either of them.  I&quot;     
##  [8504] &quot;have no notion of people&#39;s making such a to-do about money and&quot;              
##  [8505] &quot;greatness.  There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should&quot;      
##  [8506] &quot;not marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her&quot;     
##  [8507] &quot;son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than&quot;     
##  [8508] &quot;any body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs.&quot;           
##  [8509] &quot;Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as&quot;         
##  [8510] &quot;good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight.  Lord!&quot;        
##  [8511] &quot;how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours--or a little&quot;      
##  [8512] &quot;bigger--with two maids, and two men; and I believe I could help them to&quot;     
##  [8513] &quot;a housemaid, for my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit&quot;         
##  [8514] &quot;them exactly.\&quot;&quot;                                                             
##  [8515] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8516] &quot;Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to collect&quot;     
##  [8517] &quot;her thoughts, she was able to give such an answer, and make such&quot;            
##  [8518] &quot;observations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.&quot;        
##  [8519] &quot;Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest&quot;      
##  [8520] &quot;in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late often hoped might be the&quot;      
##  [8521] &quot;case) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward; and happy&quot;        
##  [8522] &quot;above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able&quot;     
##  [8523] &quot;to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her judgment,&quot;     
##  [8524] &quot;as she believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every one&quot;              
##  [8525] &quot;concerned in it.&quot;                                                            
##  [8526] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8527] &quot;She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really&quot;     
##  [8528] &quot;was; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being&quot;       
##  [8529] &quot;possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and&quot;       
##  [8530] &quot;Lucy.  What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could not be a&quot;      
##  [8531] &quot;doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear; and still more anxious to&quot;     
##  [8532] &quot;know how Edward would conduct himself.  For HIM she felt much&quot;               
##  [8533] &quot;compassion;--for Lucy very little--and it cost her some pains to&quot;            
##  [8534] &quot;procure that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.&quot;                
##  [8535] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8536] &quot;As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the&quot;        
##  [8537] &quot;necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion.  No time was to be&quot;      
##  [8538] &quot;lost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth,&quot;      
##  [8539] &quot;and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,&quot;            
##  [8540] &quot;without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister, or any&quot;       
##  [8541] &quot;resentment against Edward.&quot;                                                  
##  [8542] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8543] &quot;Elinor&#39;s office was a painful one.--She was going to remove what she&quot;        
##  [8544] &quot;really believed to be her sister&#39;s chief consolation,--to give such&quot;         
##  [8545] &quot;particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good&quot;     
##  [8546] &quot;opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,&quot;        
##  [8547] &quot;which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own disappointment&quot;       
##  [8548] &quot;over again.  But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was necessary to&quot;      
##  [8549] &quot;be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.&quot;                       
##  [8550] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8551] &quot;She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or to&quot;           
##  [8552] &quot;represent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the&quot;              
##  [8553] &quot;self-command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward&#39;s&quot;        
##  [8554] &quot;engagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.&quot;       
##  [8555] &quot;Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given&quot;        
##  [8556] &quot;without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor&quot;           
##  [8557] &quot;impetuous grief.--THAT belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne&quot;          
##  [8558] &quot;listened with horror, and cried excessively.  Elinor was to be the&quot;          
##  [8559] &quot;comforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; and&quot;      
##  [8560] &quot;all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure&quot;      
##  [8561] &quot;of mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but&quot;     
##  [8562] &quot;of imprudence, was readily offered.&quot;                                         
##  [8563] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8564] &quot;But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither.  Edward seemed&quot;     
##  [8565] &quot;a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she HAD&quot;          
##  [8566] &quot;loved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself!  As for&quot;         
##  [8567] &quot;Lucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely&quot;         
##  [8568] &quot;incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded&quot;      
##  [8569] &quot;at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of&quot;      
##  [8570] &quot;Edward for her.  She would not even admit it to have been natural; and&quot;      
##  [8571] &quot;Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which only&quot;          
##  [8572] &quot;could convince her, a better knowledge of mankind.&quot;                          
##  [8573] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8574] &quot;Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact&quot;       
##  [8575] &quot;of the engagement, and the length of time it had existed.--Marianne&#39;s&quot;       
##  [8576] &quot;feelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of&quot;            
##  [8577] &quot;detail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her&quot;          
##  [8578] &quot;distress, lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.  The first&quot;          
##  [8579] &quot;question on her side, which led to farther particulars, was,--&quot;              
##  [8580] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8581] &quot;\&quot;How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he written to you?\&quot;&quot;     
##  [8582] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8583] &quot;\&quot;I have known it these four months.  When Lucy first came to Barton&quot;        
##  [8584] &quot;Park last November, she told me in confidence of her engagement.\&quot;&quot;          
##  [8585] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8586] &quot;At these words, Marianne&#39;s eyes expressed the astonishment which her&quot;        
##  [8587] &quot;lips could not utter.  After a pause of wonder, she exclaimed--&quot;             
##  [8588] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8589] &quot;\&quot;Four months!--Have you known of this four months?\&quot;&quot;                       
##  [8590] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8591] &quot;Elinor confirmed it.&quot;                                                        
##  [8592] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8593] &quot;\&quot;What!--while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your&quot;         
##  [8594] &quot;heart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!\&quot;--&quot;                      
##  [8595] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8596] &quot;\&quot;It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!\&quot;&quot;    
##  [8597] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8598] &quot;\&quot;Four months!\&quot;--cried Marianne again.--\&quot;So calm!--so cheerful!--how&quot;      
##  [8599] &quot;have you been supported?\&quot;--&quot;                                                
##  [8600] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8601] &quot;\&quot;By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to Lucy, obliged me&quot;      
##  [8602] &quot;to be secret.  I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of&quot;     
##  [8603] &quot;the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in&quot;         
##  [8604] &quot;them a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to&quot;            
##  [8605] &quot;satisfy.\&quot;&quot;                                                                  
##  [8606] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8607] &quot;Marianne seemed much struck.&quot;                                                
##  [8608] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8609] &quot;\&quot;I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother,\&quot; added&quot;     
##  [8610] &quot;Elinor; \&quot;and once or twice I have attempted it;--but without betraying&quot;     
##  [8611] &quot;my trust, I never could have convinced you.\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [8612] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8613] &quot;\&quot;Four months!--and yet you loved him!\&quot;--&quot;                                  
##  [8614] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8615] &quot;\&quot;Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort of others was&quot;    
##  [8616] &quot;dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt.&quot;          
##  [8617] &quot;Now, I can think and speak of it with little emotion.  I would not have&quot;     
##  [8618] &quot;you suffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffer&quot;               
##  [8619] &quot;materially myself.  I have many things to support me.  I am not&quot;             
##  [8620] &quot;conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my&quot;     
##  [8621] &quot;own, I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther.&quot;      
##  [8622] &quot;I acquit Edward of essential misconduct.  I wish him very happy; and I&quot;      
##  [8623] &quot;am so sure of his always doing his duty, that though now he may harbour&quot;     
##  [8624] &quot;some regret, in the end he must become so.  Lucy does not want sense,&quot;       
##  [8625] &quot;and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.--And&quot;     
##  [8626] &quot;after all, Marianne, after all that is bewitching in the idea of a&quot;          
##  [8627] &quot;single and constant attachment, and all that can be said of one&#39;s&quot;           
##  [8628] &quot;happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is not&quot;            
##  [8629] &quot;meant--it is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.-- Edward&quot;     
##  [8630] &quot;will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person and&quot;               
##  [8631] &quot;understanding to half her sex; and time and habit will teach him to&quot;         
##  [8632] &quot;forget that he ever thought another superior to HER.\&quot;--&quot;                    
##  [8633] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8634] &quot;\&quot;If such is your way of thinking,\&quot; said Marianne, \&quot;if the loss of what&quot;   
##  [8635] &quot;is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your&quot;           
##  [8636] &quot;resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be&quot;            
##  [8637] &quot;wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension.\&quot;&quot;              
##  [8638] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8639] &quot;\&quot;I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--For&quot;    
##  [8640] &quot;four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without&quot;      
##  [8641] &quot;being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it&quot;       
##  [8642] &quot;would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to&quot;     
##  [8643] &quot;you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was told&quot;           
##  [8644] &quot;me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose&quot;      
##  [8645] &quot;prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought,&quot;        
##  [8646] &quot;with triumph.-- This person&#39;s suspicions, therefore, I have had to&quot;          
##  [8647] &quot;oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most&quot;        
##  [8648] &quot;deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her&quot;          
##  [8649] &quot;hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known&quot;           
##  [8650] &quot;myself to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one&quot;              
##  [8651] &quot;circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing&quot;        
##  [8652] &quot;has proved him unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to&quot;       
##  [8653] &quot;me.-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister, and&quot;       
##  [8654] &quot;the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the punishment of an&quot;         
##  [8655] &quot;attachment, without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has been&quot;        
##  [8656] &quot;going on at a time, when, as you know too well, it has not been my only&quot;     
##  [8657] &quot;unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you&quot;      
##  [8658] &quot;may suppose that I have suffered NOW.  The composure of mind with which&quot;     
##  [8659] &quot;I have brought myself at present to consider the matter, the&quot;                
##  [8660] &quot;consolation that I have been willing to admit, have been the effect of&quot;      
##  [8661] &quot;constant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up of&quot;                   
##  [8662] &quot;themselves;--they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No,&quot;       
##  [8663] &quot;Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothing&quot;        
##  [8664] &quot;could have kept me entirely--not even what I owed to my dearest&quot;             
##  [8665] &quot;friends--from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy.\&quot;--&quot;                   
##  [8666] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8667] &quot;Marianne was quite subdued.--&quot;                                               
##  [8668] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8669] &quot;\&quot;Oh! Elinor,\&quot; she cried, \&quot;you have made me hate myself for ever.--How&quot;    
##  [8670] &quot;barbarous have I been to you!--you, who have been my only comfort, who&quot;      
##  [8671] &quot;have borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only&quot;             
##  [8672] &quot;suffering for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I can&quot;     
##  [8673] &quot;make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying&quot;     
##  [8674] &quot;to do it away.\&quot;&quot;                                                            
##  [8675] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8676] &quot;The tenderest caresses followed this confession.  In such a frame of&quot;        
##  [8677] &quot;mind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her&quot;      
##  [8678] &quot;whatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged&quot;         
##  [8679] &quot;never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of&quot;        
##  [8680] &quot;bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of&quot;        
##  [8681] &quot;dislike to her;--and even to see Edward himself, if chance should bring&quot;     
##  [8682] &quot;them together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality.-- These&quot;      
##  [8683] &quot;were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she had injured,&quot;      
##  [8684] &quot;no reparation could be too much for her to make.&quot;                            
##  [8685] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8686] &quot;She performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration.--She&quot;            
##  [8687] &quot;attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an&quot;     
##  [8688] &quot;unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard&quot;         
##  [8689] &quot;three times to say, \&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.\&quot;--She listened to her praise of Lucy&quot;     
##  [8690] &quot;with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings&quot;          
##  [8691] &quot;talked of Edward&#39;s affection, it cost her only a spasm in her&quot;               
##  [8692] &quot;throat.--Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel&quot;      
##  [8693] &quot;equal to any thing herself.&quot;                                                 
##  [8694] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8695] &quot;The next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their&quot;       
##  [8696] &quot;brother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful&quot;      
##  [8697] &quot;affair, and bring them news of his wife.&quot;                                    
##  [8698] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8699] &quot;\&quot;You have heard, I suppose,\&quot; said he with great solemnity, as soon as&quot;     
##  [8700] &quot;he was seated, \&quot;of the very shocking discovery that took place under&quot;       
##  [8701] &quot;our roof yesterday.\&quot;&quot;                                                       
##  [8702] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8703] &quot;They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech.&quot;      
##  [8704] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8705] &quot;\&quot;Your sister,\&quot; he continued, \&quot;has suffered dreadfully.  Mrs. Ferrars&quot;     
##  [8706] &quot;too--in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress--but I&quot;       
##  [8707] &quot;will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us&quot;       
##  [8708] &quot;quite overcome.  Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday.  But I&quot;     
##  [8709] &quot;would not alarm you too much.  Donavan says there is nothing materially&quot;     
##  [8710] &quot;to be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her resolution&quot;       
##  [8711] &quot;equal to any thing.  She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an&quot;         
##  [8712] &quot;angel!  She says she never shall think well of anybody again; and one&quot;       
##  [8713] &quot;cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--meeting with such&quot;            
##  [8714] &quot;ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shewn, so much confidence&quot;      
##  [8715] &quot;had been placed!  It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart,&quot;         
##  [8716] &quot;that she had asked these young women to her house; merely because she&quot;       
##  [8717] &quot;thought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behaved&quot;           
##  [8718] &quot;girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wished&quot;       
##  [8719] &quot;very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while your&quot;        
##  [8720] &quot;kind friend there, was attending her daughter.  And now to be so&quot;            
##  [8721] &quot;rewarded!  &#39;I wish, with all my heart,&#39; says poor Fanny in her&quot;              
##  [8722] &quot;affectionate way, &#39;that we had asked your sisters instead of them.&#39;\&quot;&quot;       
##  [8723] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8724] &quot;Here he stopped to be thanked; which being done, he went on.&quot;                
##  [8725] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8726] &quot;\&quot;What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, is&quot;     
##  [8727] &quot;not to be described.  While she with the truest affection had been&quot;          
##  [8728] &quot;planning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed that&quot;     
##  [8729] &quot;he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such a&quot;        
##  [8730] &quot;suspicion could never have entered her head!  If she suspected ANY&quot;          
##  [8731] &quot;prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in THAT quarter.  &#39;THERE, to&quot;       
##  [8732] &quot;be sure,&#39; said she, &#39;I might have thought myself safe.&#39; She was quite&quot;       
##  [8733] &quot;in an agony.  We consulted together, however, as to what should be&quot;          
##  [8734] &quot;done, and at last she determined to send for Edward.  He came.  But I&quot;       
##  [8735] &quot;am sorry to relate what ensued.  All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to&quot;         
##  [8736] &quot;make him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well&quot;         
##  [8737] &quot;suppose by my arguments, and Fanny&#39;s entreaties, was of no avail.&quot;           
##  [8738] &quot;Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.  I never thought Edward&quot;       
##  [8739] &quot;so stubborn, so unfeeling before.  His mother explained to him her&quot;          
##  [8740] &quot;liberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she&quot;          
##  [8741] &quot;would settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax,&quot;           
##  [8742] &quot;brings in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters grew&quot;           
##  [8743] &quot;desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he&quot;      
##  [8744] &quot;still persisted in this low connection, represented to him the certain&quot;      
##  [8745] &quot;penury that must attend the match.  His own two thousand pounds she&quot;         
##  [8746] &quot;protested should be his all; she would never see him again; and so far&quot;      
##  [8747] &quot;would she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if he&quot;         
##  [8748] &quot;were to enter into any profession with a view of better support, she&quot;        
##  [8749] &quot;would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it.\&quot;&quot;                 
##  [8750] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8751] &quot;Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her hands&quot;              
##  [8752] &quot;together, and cried, \&quot;Gracious God!  can this be possible!\&quot;&quot;               
##  [8753] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8754] &quot;\&quot;Well may you wonder, Marianne,\&quot; replied her brother, \&quot;at the obstinacy&quot;  
##  [8755] &quot;which could resist such arguments as these.  Your exclamation is very&quot;       
##  [8756] &quot;natural.\&quot;&quot;                                                                  
##  [8757] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8758] &quot;Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered her promises, and&quot;          
##  [8759] &quot;forbore.&quot;                                                                    
##  [8760] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8761] &quot;\&quot;All this, however,\&quot; he continued, \&quot;was urged in vain.  Edward said&quot;      
##  [8762] &quot;very little; but what he did say, was in the most determined manner.&quot;        
##  [8763] &quot;Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement.  He would&quot;          
##  [8764] &quot;stand to it, cost him what it might.\&quot;&quot;                                      
##  [8765] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8766] &quot;\&quot;Then,\&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, no longer able to be&quot;    
##  [8767] &quot;silent, \&quot;he has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr.&quot;           
##  [8768] &quot;Dashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I should have thought him a&quot;         
##  [8769] &quot;rascal.  I have some little concern in the business, as well as&quot;             
##  [8770] &quot;yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a&quot;        
##  [8771] &quot;better kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good&quot;          
##  [8772] &quot;husband.\&quot;&quot;                                                                  
##  [8773] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8774] &quot;John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature was calm, not open&quot;     
##  [8775] &quot;to provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especially&quot;           
##  [8776] &quot;anybody of good fortune.  He therefore replied, without any resentment,&quot;     
##  [8777] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8778] &quot;\&quot;I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours,&quot;       
##  [8779] &quot;madam.  Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman,&quot;      
##  [8780] &quot;but in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible.&quot;        
##  [8781] &quot;And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her&quot;     
##  [8782] &quot;uncle&#39;s care, the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune&quot;      
##  [8783] &quot;as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In&quot;          
##  [8784] &quot;short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom&quot;       
##  [8785] &quot;you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  We all wish her extremely happy;&quot;     
##  [8786] &quot;and Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s conduct throughout the whole, has been such as every&quot;     
##  [8787] &quot;conscientious, good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt.  It has&quot;     
##  [8788] &quot;been dignified and liberal.  Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear&quot;       
##  [8789] &quot;it will be a bad one.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##  [8790] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8791] &quot;Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension; and Elinor&#39;s heart wrung&quot;      
##  [8792] &quot;for the feelings of Edward, while braving his mother&#39;s threats, for a&quot;       
##  [8793] &quot;woman who could not reward him.&quot;                                             
##  [8794] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8795] &quot;\&quot;Well, sir,\&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, \&quot;and how did it end?\&quot;&quot;                  
##  [8796] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8797] &quot;\&quot;I am sorry to say, ma&#39;am, in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward is&quot;          
##  [8798] &quot;dismissed for ever from his mother&#39;s notice.  He left her house&quot;             
##  [8799] &quot;yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do&quot;       
##  [8800] &quot;not know; for WE of course can make no inquiry.\&quot;&quot;                           
##  [8801] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8802] &quot;\&quot;Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?\&quot;&quot;                          
##  [8803] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8804] &quot;\&quot;What, indeed, ma&#39;am!  It is a melancholy consideration.  Born to the&quot;      
##  [8805] &quot;prospect of such affluence!  I cannot conceive a situation more&quot;             
##  [8806] &quot;deplorable.  The interest of two thousand pounds--how can a man live on&quot;     
##  [8807] &quot;it?--and when to that is added the recollection, that he might, but for&quot;     
##  [8808] &quot;his own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of two&quot;          
##  [8809] &quot;thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has thirty thousand&quot;          
##  [8810] &quot;pounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition.  We must&quot;     
##  [8811] &quot;all feel for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of our&quot;         
##  [8812] &quot;power to assist him.\&quot;&quot;                                                      
##  [8813] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8814] &quot;\&quot;Poor young man!\&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings, \&quot;I am sure he should be very&quot;      
##  [8815] &quot;welcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him if I&quot;          
##  [8816] &quot;could see him.  It is not fit that he should be living about at his own&quot;     
##  [8817] &quot;charge now, at lodgings and taverns.\&quot;&quot;                                      
##  [8818] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8819] &quot;Elinor&#39;s heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward, though she&quot;     
##  [8820] &quot;could not forbear smiling at the form of it.&quot;                                
##  [8821] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8822] &quot;\&quot;If he would only have done as well by himself,\&quot; said John Dashwood,&quot;      
##  [8823] &quot;\&quot;as all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have been&quot;     
##  [8824] &quot;in his proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing.  But as it&quot;      
##  [8825] &quot;is, it must be out of anybody&#39;s power to assist him.  And there is one&quot;      
##  [8826] &quot;thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than all--his&quot;         
##  [8827] &quot;mother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle&quot;        
##  [8828] &quot;THAT estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward&#39;s, on&quot;     
##  [8829] &quot;proper conditions.  I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking&quot;        
##  [8830] &quot;over the business.\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##  [8831] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8832] &quot;\&quot;Well!\&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, \&quot;that is HER revenge.  Everybody has a way&quot;   
##  [8833] &quot;of their own.  But I don&#39;t think mine would be, to make one son&quot;             
##  [8834] &quot;independent, because another had plagued me.\&quot;&quot;                              
##  [8835] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8836] &quot;Marianne got up and walked about the room.&quot;                                  
##  [8837] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8838] &quot;\&quot;Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,\&quot; continued John,&quot;    
##  [8839] &quot;\&quot;than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might&quot;    
##  [8840] &quot;have been his own?  Poor Edward!  I feel for him sincerely.\&quot;&quot;               
##  [8841] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8842] &quot;A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded his&quot;        
##  [8843] &quot;visit; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really&quot;           
##  [8844] &quot;believed there was no material danger in Fanny&#39;s indisposition, and&quot;         
##  [8845] &quot;that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;&quot;         
##  [8846] &quot;leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present&quot;       
##  [8847] &quot;occasion, as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s conduct, the&quot;        
##  [8848] &quot;Dashwoods&#39;, and Edward&#39;s.&quot;                                                   
##  [8849] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8850] &quot;Marianne&#39;s indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room; and&quot;      
##  [8851] &quot;as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in&quot;      
##  [8852] &quot;Mrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the&quot;         
##  [8853] &quot;party.&quot;                                                                      
##  [8854] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8855] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8856] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8857] &quot;CHAPTER 38&quot;                                                                  
##  [8858] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8859] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8860] &quot;Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward&#39;s conduct, but only&quot;     
##  [8861] &quot;Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit.  THEY only knew how&quot;          
##  [8862] &quot;little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small was the&quot;     
##  [8863] &quot;consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could remain&quot;     
##  [8864] &quot;to him in the loss of friends and fortune.  Elinor gloried in his&quot;           
##  [8865] &quot;integrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his&quot;      
##  [8866] &quot;punishment.  But though confidence between them was, by this public&quot;         
##  [8867] &quot;discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on which&quot;      
##  [8868] &quot;either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.  Elinor avoided it&quot;         
##  [8869] &quot;upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the&quot;      
##  [8870] &quot;too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward&#39;s&quot;      
##  [8871] &quot;continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away; and&quot;     
##  [8872] &quot;Marianne&#39;s courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topic&quot;      
##  [8873] &quot;which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the&quot;      
##  [8874] &quot;comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor&#39;s conduct and her own.&quot;    
##  [8875] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8876] &quot;She felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her sister had&quot;        
##  [8877] &quot;hoped, to urge her to exertion now; she felt it with all the pain of&quot;        
##  [8878] &quot;continual self-reproach, regretted most bitterly that she had never&quot;         
##  [8879] &quot;exerted herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,&quot;       
##  [8880] &quot;without the hope of amendment.  Her mind was so much weakened that she&quot;      
##  [8881] &quot;still fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it only&quot;            
##  [8882] &quot;dispirited her more.&quot;                                                        
##  [8883] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8884] &quot;Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairs&quot;      
##  [8885] &quot;in Harley Street, or Bartlett&#39;s Buildings.  But though so much of the&quot;       
##  [8886] &quot;matter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had&quot;         
##  [8887] &quot;enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking after&quot;     
##  [8888] &quot;more, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and&quot;         
##  [8889] &quot;inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but the&quot;            
##  [8890] &quot;hindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to them&quot;      
##  [8891] &quot;within that time.&quot;                                                           
##  [8892] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8893] &quot;The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so&quot;         
##  [8894] &quot;fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens,&quot;          
##  [8895] &quot;though it was only the second week in March.  Mrs. Jennings and Elinor&quot;      
##  [8896] &quot;were of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were&quot;        
##  [8897] &quot;again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather&quot;       
##  [8898] &quot;to stay at home, than venture into so public a place.&quot;                       
##  [8899] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8900] &quot;An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they&quot;       
##  [8901] &quot;entered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing&quot;        
##  [8902] &quot;with them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings&#39;s conversation, she was&quot;           
##  [8903] &quot;herself left to quiet reflection.  She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,&quot;      
##  [8904] &quot;nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by&quot;        
##  [8905] &quot;any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her.  But at last&quot;        
##  [8906] &quot;she found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who,&quot;         
##  [8907] &quot;though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting&quot;          
##  [8908] &quot;them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of&quot;        
##  [8909] &quot;Mrs. Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their&#39;s.&quot;        
##  [8910] &quot;Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,&quot;                              
##  [8911] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8912] &quot;\&quot;Get it all out of her, my dear.  She will tell you any thing if you&quot;       
##  [8913] &quot;ask.  You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.\&quot;&quot;                                 
##  [8914] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8915] &quot;It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings&#39;s curiosity and Elinor&#39;s too,&quot;      
##  [8916] &quot;that she would tell any thing WITHOUT being asked; for nothing would&quot;        
##  [8917] &quot;otherwise have been learnt.&quot;                                                 
##  [8918] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8919] &quot;\&quot;I am so glad to meet you;\&quot; said Miss Steele, taking her familiarly by&quot;    
##  [8920] &quot;the arm--\&quot;for I wanted to see you of all things in the world.\&quot;  And&quot;       
##  [8921] &quot;then lowering her voice, \&quot;I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about&quot;      
##  [8922] &quot;it.  Is she angry?\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##  [8923] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8924] &quot;\&quot;Not at all, I believe, with you.\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [8925] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8926] &quot;\&quot;That is a good thing.  And Lady Middleton, is SHE angry?\&quot;&quot;                
##  [8927] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8928] &quot;\&quot;I cannot suppose it possible that she should be.\&quot;&quot;                        
##  [8929] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8930] &quot;\&quot;I am monstrous glad of it.  Good gracious!  I have had such a time of&quot;     
##  [8931] &quot;it!  I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life.  She vowed at first&quot;        
##  [8932] &quot;she would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me&quot;       
##  [8933] &quot;again, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we are&quot;       
##  [8934] &quot;as good friends as ever.  Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and put&quot;     
##  [8935] &quot;in the feather last night.  There now, YOU are going to laugh at me&quot;         
##  [8936] &quot;too.  But why should not I wear pink ribbons?  I do not care if it IS&quot;       
##  [8937] &quot;the Doctor&#39;s favourite colour.  I am sure, for my part, I should never&quot;      
##  [8938] &quot;have known he DID like it better than any other colour, if he had not&quot;       
##  [8939] &quot;happened to say so.  My cousins have been so plaguing me!  I declare&quot;        
##  [8940] &quot;sometimes I do not know which way to look before them.\&quot;&quot;                    
##  [8941] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8942] &quot;She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say,&quot;      
##  [8943] &quot;and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to&quot;        
##  [8944] &quot;the first.&quot;                                                                  
##  [8945] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8946] &quot;\&quot;Well, but Miss Dashwood,\&quot; speaking triumphantly, \&quot;people may say what&quot;   
##  [8947] &quot;they chuse about Mr. Ferrars&#39;s declaring he would not have Lucy, for it&quot;     
##  [8948] &quot;is no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such&quot;           
##  [8949] &quot;ill-natured reports to be spread abroad.  Whatever Lucy might think&quot;         
##  [8950] &quot;about it herself, you know, it was no business of other people to set&quot;       
##  [8951] &quot;it down for certain.\&quot;&quot;                                                      
##  [8952] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8953] &quot;\&quot;I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you,\&quot;&quot;     
##  [8954] &quot;said Elinor.&quot;                                                                
##  [8955] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [8956] &quot;\&quot;Oh, did not you?  But it WAS said, I know, very well, and by more than&quot;    
##  [8957] &quot;one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses could&quot;     
##  [8958] &quot;expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty&quot;         
##  [8959] &quot;thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing at&quot;         
##  [8960] &quot;all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself.  And besides that, my cousin&quot;     
##  [8961] &quot;Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr.&quot;      
##  [8962] &quot;Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us for three&quot;        
##  [8963] &quot;days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in my heart&quot;      
##  [8964] &quot;Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your brother&#39;s&quot;          
##  [8965] &quot;Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, and&quot;          
##  [8966] &quot;Saturday, and did not know what was become of him.  Once Lucy thought&quot;       
##  [8967] &quot;to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that.  However this&quot;      
##  [8968] &quot;morning he came just as we came home from church; and then it all came&quot;      
##  [8969] &quot;out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and been&quot;          
##  [8970] &quot;talked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had declared before&quot;     
##  [8971] &quot;them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he&quot;        
##  [8972] &quot;have.  And how he had been so worried by what passed, that as soon as&quot;       
##  [8973] &quot;he had went away from his mother&#39;s house, he had got upon his horse,&quot;        
##  [8974] &quot;and rid into the country, some where or other; and how he had stayed&quot;        
##  [8975] &quot;about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better&quot;       
##  [8976] &quot;of it.  And after thinking it all over and over again, he said, it&quot;          
##  [8977] &quot;seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at all, it&quot;       
##  [8978] &quot;would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because it must&quot;     
##  [8979] &quot;be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no&quot;         
##  [8980] &quot;hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he had some&quot;     
##  [8981] &quot;thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they to live&quot;       
##  [8982] &quot;upon that?--He could not bear to think of her doing no better, and so&quot;       
##  [8983] &quot;he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the&quot;           
##  [8984] &quot;matter directly, and leave him shift for himself.  I heard him say all&quot;      
##  [8985] &quot;this as plain as could possibly be.  And it was entirely for HER sake,&quot;      
##  [8986] &quot;and upon HER account, that he said a word about being off, and not upon&quot;     
##  [8987] &quot;his own.  I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired&quot;      
##  [8988] &quot;of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing like it.  But,&quot;     
##  [8989] &quot;to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so she&quot;         
##  [8990] &quot;told him directly (with a great deal about sweet and love, you know,&quot;        
##  [8991] &quot;and all that--Oh, la! one can&#39;t repeat such kind of things you&quot;              
##  [8992] &quot;know)--she told him directly, she had not the least mind in the world&quot;       
##  [8993] &quot;to be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how little so&quot;     
##  [8994] &quot;ever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all, you know,&quot;       
##  [8995] &quot;or something of the kind.  So then he was monstrous happy, and talked&quot;       
##  [8996] &quot;on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he should take&quot;      
##  [8997] &quot;orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he got a living.&quot;     
##  [8998] &quot;And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin called from&quot;          
##  [8999] &quot;below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and would take&quot;      
##  [9000] &quot;one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into the room&quot;        
##  [9001] &quot;and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did&quot;        
##  [9002] &quot;not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of&quot;      
##  [9003] &quot;silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [9004] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9005] &quot;\&quot;I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,\&quot; said Elinor;&quot;    
##  [9006] &quot;\&quot;you were all in the same room together, were not you?\&quot;&quot;                   
##  [9007] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9008] &quot;\&quot;No, indeed, not us.  La! Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love&quot;     
##  [9009] &quot;when any body else is by?  Oh, for shame!--To be sure you must know&quot;         
##  [9010] &quot;better than that.  (Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in&quot;     
##  [9011] &quot;the drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at the&quot;     
##  [9012] &quot;door.\&quot;&quot;                                                                     
##  [9013] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9014] &quot;\&quot;How!\&quot; cried Elinor; \&quot;have you been repeating to me what you only&quot;        
##  [9015] &quot;learnt yourself by listening at the door?  I am sorry I did not know it&quot;     
##  [9016] &quot;before; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me&quot;              
##  [9017] &quot;particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known&quot;             
##  [9018] &quot;yourself.  How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?\&quot;&quot;               
##  [9019] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9020] &quot;\&quot;Oh, la! there is nothing in THAT.  I only stood at the door, and heard&quot;    
##  [9021] &quot;what I could.  And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me;&quot;      
##  [9022] &quot;for a year or two back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets&quot;        
##  [9023] &quot;together, she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind a&quot;       
##  [9024] &quot;chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.\&quot;&quot;                           
##  [9025] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9026] &quot;Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss Steele could not be&quot;        
##  [9027] &quot;kept beyond a couple of minutes, from what was uppermost in her mind.&quot;       
##  [9028] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9029] &quot;\&quot;Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,\&quot; said she; \&quot;but now he is&quot;         
##  [9030] &quot;lodging at No. --, Pall Mall.  What an ill-natured woman his mother is,&quot;     
##  [9031] &quot;an&#39;t she? And your brother and sister were not very kind! However, I&quot;        
##  [9032] &quot;shan&#39;t say anything against them to YOU; and to be sure they did send&quot;       
##  [9033] &quot;us home in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for.  And&quot;        
##  [9034] &quot;for my part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us&quot;       
##  [9035] &quot;for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,&quot;         
##  [9036] &quot;nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of sight.&quot;     
##  [9037] &quot;Edward have got some business at Oxford, he says; so he must go there&quot;       
##  [9038] &quot;for a time; and after THAT, as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he&quot;       
##  [9039] &quot;will be ordained.  I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious!&quot;        
##  [9040] &quot;(giggling as she spoke) I&#39;d lay my life I know what my cousins will&quot;         
##  [9041] &quot;say, when they hear of it.  They will tell me I should write to the&quot;         
##  [9042] &quot;Doctor, to get Edward the curacy of his new living.  I know they will;&quot;      
##  [9043] &quot;but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.-- &#39;La!&#39; I&quot;      
##  [9044] &quot;shall say directly, &#39;I wonder how you could think of such a thing?  I&quot;       
##  [9045] &quot;write to the Doctor, indeed!&#39;\&quot;&quot;                                             
##  [9046] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9047] &quot;\&quot;Well,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst.&quot;  
##  [9048] &quot;You have got your answer ready.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [9049] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9050] &quot;Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach of&quot;     
##  [9051] &quot;her own party made another more necessary.&quot;                                  
##  [9052] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9053] &quot;\&quot;Oh, la! here come the Richardsons.  I had a vast deal more to say to&quot;      
##  [9054] &quot;you, but I must not stay away from them not any longer.  I assure you&quot;       
##  [9055] &quot;they are very genteel people.  He makes a monstrous deal of money, and&quot;      
##  [9056] &quot;they keep their own coach.  I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings&quot;       
##  [9057] &quot;about it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not&quot;      
##  [9058] &quot;in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same; and if anything&quot;           
##  [9059] &quot;should happen to take you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jennings&quot;           
##  [9060] &quot;should want company, I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay&quot;      
##  [9061] &quot;with her for as long a time as she likes.  I suppose Lady Middleton&quot;         
##  [9062] &quot;won&#39;t ask us any more this bout.  Good-by; I am sorry Miss Marianne was&quot;     
##  [9063] &quot;not here.  Remember me kindly to her.  La! if you have not got your&quot;         
##  [9064] &quot;spotted muslin on!--I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn.\&quot;&quot;        
##  [9065] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9066] &quot;Such was her parting concern; for after this, she had time only to pay&quot;      
##  [9067] &quot;her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, before her company was&quot;           
##  [9068] &quot;claimed by Mrs. Richardson; and Elinor was left in possession of&quot;            
##  [9069] &quot;knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time, though&quot;       
##  [9070] &quot;she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and&quot;     
##  [9071] &quot;foreplanned in her own mind.  Edward&#39;s marriage with Lucy was as firmly&quot;     
##  [9072] &quot;determined on, and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely&quot;      
##  [9073] &quot;uncertain, as she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended,&quot;         
##  [9074] &quot;exactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment, of&quot;           
##  [9075] &quot;which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.&quot;                    
##  [9076] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9077] &quot;As soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager for&quot;       
##  [9078] &quot;information; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible&quot;           
##  [9079] &quot;intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained, she&quot;     
##  [9080] &quot;confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars, as&quot;     
##  [9081] &quot;she felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her own consequence, would&quot;      
##  [9082] &quot;choose to have known.  The continuance of their engagement, and the&quot;         
##  [9083] &quot;means that were able to be taken for promoting its end, was all her&quot;         
##  [9084] &quot;communication; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following&quot;           
##  [9085] &quot;natural remark.&quot;                                                             
##  [9086] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9087] &quot;\&quot;Wait for his having a living!--ay, we all know how THAT will&quot;              
##  [9088] &quot;end:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it,&quot;        
##  [9089] &quot;will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year, with the interest&quot;       
##  [9090] &quot;of his two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr.&quot;       
##  [9091] &quot;Pratt can give her.--Then they will have a child every year! and Lord&quot;       
##  [9092] &quot;help &#39;em! how poor they will be!--I must see what I can give them&quot;           
##  [9093] &quot;towards furnishing their house.  Two maids and two men, indeed!--as I&quot;       
##  [9094] &quot;talked of t&#39;other day.--No, no, they must get a stout girl of all&quot;           
##  [9095] &quot;works.-- Betty&#39;s sister would never do for them NOW.\&quot;&quot;                      
##  [9096] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9097] &quot;The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from&quot;         
##  [9098] &quot;Lucy herself.  It was as follows:&quot;                                           
##  [9099] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9100] &quot;                    \&quot;Bartlett&#39;s Building, March.&quot;                           
##  [9101] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9102] &quot;     \&quot;I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the&quot;                         
##  [9103] &quot;     liberty I take of writing to her; but I know your&quot;                      
##  [9104] &quot;     friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such&quot;                   
##  [9105] &quot;     a good account of myself and my dear Edward, after&quot;                     
##  [9106] &quot;     all the troubles we have went through lately,&quot;                          
##  [9107] &quot;     therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed&quot;                     
##  [9108] &quot;     to say that, thank God! though we have suffered&quot;                        
##  [9109] &quot;     dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy&quot;                   
##  [9110] &quot;     as we must always be in one another&#39;s love.  We have&quot;                   
##  [9111] &quot;     had great trials, and great persecutions, but&quot;                          
##  [9112] &quot;     however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge&quot;                      
##  [9113] &quot;     many friends, yourself not the least among them,&quot;                       
##  [9114] &quot;     whose great kindness I shall always thankfully&quot;                         
##  [9115] &quot;     remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of&quot;                       
##  [9116] &quot;     it.  I am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise&quot;                   
##  [9117] &quot;     dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours with&quot;                       
##  [9118] &quot;     him yesterday afternoon, he would not hear of our&quot;                      
##  [9119] &quot;     parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought my&quot;                       
##  [9120] &quot;     duty required, urge him to it for prudence sake,&quot;                       
##  [9121] &quot;     and would have parted for ever on the spot, would&quot;                      
##  [9122] &quot;     he consent to it; but he said it should never be,&quot;                      
##  [9123] &quot;     he did not regard his mother&#39;s anger, while he could&quot;                   
##  [9124] &quot;     have my affections; our prospects are not very&quot;                         
##  [9125] &quot;     bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope for&quot;                     
##  [9126] &quot;     the best; he will be ordained shortly; and should&quot;                      
##  [9127] &quot;     it ever be in your power to recommend him to any&quot;                       
##  [9128] &quot;     body that has a living to bestow, am very sure you&quot;                     
##  [9129] &quot;     will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too,&quot;                        
##  [9130] &quot;     trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John,&quot;                   
##  [9131] &quot;     or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to&quot;                       
##  [9132] &quot;     assist us.--Poor Anne was much to blame for what&quot;                       
##  [9133] &quot;     she did, but she did it for the best, so I say&quot;                         
##  [9134] &quot;     nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won&#39;t think it too much&quot;                    
##  [9135] &quot;     trouble to give us a call, should she come this way&quot;                    
##  [9136] &quot;     any morning, &#39;twould be a great kindness, and my&quot;                       
##  [9137] &quot;     cousins would be proud to know her.--My paper reminds&quot;                  
##  [9138] &quot;     me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully&quot;                      
##  [9139] &quot;     and respectfully remembered to her, and to Sir John,&quot;                   
##  [9140] &quot;     and Lady Middleton, and the dear children, when you&quot;                    
##  [9141] &quot;     chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne,&quot;                         
##  [9142] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9143] &quot;                                      \&quot;I am, &amp;c.\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [9144] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9145] &quot;As soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded to&quot;      
##  [9146] &quot;be its writer&#39;s real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs.&quot;             
##  [9147] &quot;Jennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and&quot;          
##  [9148] &quot;praise.&quot;                                                                     
##  [9149] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9150] &quot;\&quot;Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye, that was quite&quot;          
##  [9151] &quot;proper to let him be off if he would.  That was just like Lucy.--Poor&quot;       
##  [9152] &quot;soul! I wish I COULD get him a living, with all my heart.--She calls me&quot;     
##  [9153] &quot;dear Mrs. Jennings, you see.  She is a good-hearted girl as ever&quot;            
##  [9154] &quot;lived.--Very well upon my word.  That sentence is very prettily turned.&quot;     
##  [9155] &quot;Yes, yes, I will go and see her, sure enough.  How attentive she is, to&quot;     
##  [9156] &quot;think of every body!--Thank you, my dear, for shewing it me.  It is as&quot;      
##  [9157] &quot;pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy&#39;s head and heart great&quot;         
##  [9158] &quot;credit.\&quot;&quot;                                                                   
##  [9159] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9160] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9161] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9162] &quot;CHAPTER 39&quot;                                                                  
##  [9163] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9164] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9165] &quot;The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town,&quot;        
##  [9166] &quot;and Marianne&#39;s impatience to be gone increased every day.  She sighed&quot;       
##  [9167] &quot;for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if&quot;     
##  [9168] &quot;any place could give her ease, Barton must do it.  Elinor was hardly&quot;        
##  [9169] &quot;less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent&quot;     
##  [9170] &quot;on its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of the&quot;         
##  [9171] &quot;difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought&quot;      
##  [9172] &quot;to acknowledge.  She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts&quot;         
##  [9173] &quot;towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to&quot;       
##  [9174] &quot;their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her&quot;         
##  [9175] &quot;good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from&quot;     
##  [9176] &quot;home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more&quot;        
##  [9177] &quot;eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about&quot;      
##  [9178] &quot;the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both&quot;     
##  [9179] &quot;her friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with&quot;      
##  [9180] &quot;them.  This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy&quot;     
##  [9181] &quot;of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by&quot;      
##  [9182] &quot;Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of his&quot;           
##  [9183] &quot;manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy,&quot;         
##  [9184] &quot;induced her to accept it with pleasure.&quot;                                     
##  [9185] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9186] &quot;When she told Marianne what she had done, however, her first reply was&quot;      
##  [9187] &quot;not very auspicious.&quot;                                                        
##  [9188] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9189] &quot;\&quot;Cleveland!\&quot;--she cried, with great agitation.  \&quot;No, I cannot go to&quot;      
##  [9190] &quot;Cleveland.\&quot;--&quot;                                                              
##  [9191] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9192] &quot;\&quot;You forget,\&quot; said Elinor gently, \&quot;that its situation is not...that it&quot;   
##  [9193] &quot;is not in the neighbourhood of...\&quot;&quot;                                         
##  [9194] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9195] &quot;\&quot;But it is in Somersetshire.--I cannot go into Somersetshire.--There,&quot;      
##  [9196] &quot;where I looked forward to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to&quot;       
##  [9197] &quot;go there.\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [9198] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9199] &quot;Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such&quot;                
##  [9200] &quot;feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on&quot;            
##  [9201] &quot;others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix the&quot;        
##  [9202] &quot;time of her returning to that dear mother, whom she so much wished to&quot;       
##  [9203] &quot;see, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plan&quot;       
##  [9204] &quot;could do, and perhaps without any greater delay.  From Cleveland, which&quot;     
##  [9205] &quot;was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not&quot;           
##  [9206] &quot;beyond one day, though a long day&#39;s journey; and their mother&#39;s servant&quot;     
##  [9207] &quot;might easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be no&quot;       
##  [9208] &quot;occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be&quot;      
##  [9209] &quot;at home in little more than three weeks&#39; time.  As Marianne&#39;s affection&quot;     
##  [9210] &quot;for her mother was sincere, it must triumph with little difficulty,&quot;         
##  [9211] &quot;over the imaginary evils she had started.&quot;                                   
##  [9212] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9213] &quot;Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guests, that she&quot;           
##  [9214] &quot;pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland.&quot;        
##  [9215] &quot;Elinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her&quot;           
##  [9216] &quot;design; and their mother&#39;s concurrence being readily gained, every&quot;          
##  [9217] &quot;thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;--and&quot;     
##  [9218] &quot;Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that&quot;      
##  [9219] &quot;were yet to divide her from Barton.&quot;                                         
##  [9220] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9221] &quot;\&quot;Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss&quot;       
##  [9222] &quot;Dashwoods;\&quot;--was Mrs. Jennings&#39;s address to him when he first called on&quot;    
##  [9223] &quot;her, after their leaving her was settled--\&quot;for they are quite resolved&quot;     
##  [9224] &quot;upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall be, when I&quot;      
##  [9225] &quot;come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two&quot;       
##  [9226] &quot;cats.\&quot;&quot;                                                                     
##  [9227] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9228] &quot;Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their&quot;        
##  [9229] &quot;future ennui, to provoke him to make that offer, which might give&quot;           
##  [9230] &quot;himself an escape from it;--and if so, she had soon afterwards good&quot;         
##  [9231] &quot;reason to think her object gained; for, on Elinor&#39;s moving to the&quot;           
##  [9232] &quot;window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she&quot;      
##  [9233] &quot;was going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it with a look of&quot;      
##  [9234] &quot;particular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes.&quot;       
##  [9235] &quot;The effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her&quot;           
##  [9236] &quot;observation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even&quot;       
##  [9237] &quot;changed her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear, to one close by&quot;       
##  [9238] &quot;the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep&quot;           
##  [9239] &quot;herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with&quot;               
##  [9240] &quot;agitation, and was too intent on what he said to pursue her&quot;                 
##  [9241] &quot;employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the&quot;            
##  [9242] &quot;interval of Marianne&#39;s turning from one lesson to another, some words&quot;       
##  [9243] &quot;of the Colonel&#39;s inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to be&quot;       
##  [9244] &quot;apologising for the badness of his house.  This set the matter beyond a&quot;     
##  [9245] &quot;doubt.  She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so;&quot;        
##  [9246] &quot;but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.  What Elinor said in reply&quot;      
##  [9247] &quot;she could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, that&quot;     
##  [9248] &quot;she did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings&quot;           
##  [9249] &quot;commended her in her heart for being so honest.  They then talked on&quot;        
##  [9250] &quot;for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable, when another&quot;      
##  [9251] &quot;lucky stop in Marianne&#39;s performance brought her these words in the&quot;         
##  [9252] &quot;Colonel&#39;s calm voice,--&quot;                                                     
##  [9253] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9254] &quot;\&quot;I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.\&quot;&quot;                             
##  [9255] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9256] &quot;Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost&quot;          
##  [9257] &quot;ready to cry out, \&quot;Lord! what should hinder it?\&quot;--but checking her&quot;        
##  [9258] &quot;desire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation.&quot;                        
##  [9259] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9260] &quot;\&quot;This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older.\&quot;&quot;               
##  [9261] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9262] &quot;This delay on the Colonel&#39;s side, however, did not seem to offend or&quot;        
##  [9263] &quot;mortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the&quot;       
##  [9264] &quot;conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings&quot;        
##  [9265] &quot;very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to&quot;         
##  [9266] &quot;feel what she said,&quot;                                                         
##  [9267] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9268] &quot;\&quot;I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.\&quot;&quot;                   
##  [9269] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9270] &quot;Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered that&quot;      
##  [9271] &quot;after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take leave&quot;     
##  [9272] &quot;of them, as he immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away&quot;     
##  [9273] &quot;without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend could&quot;     
##  [9274] &quot;have made so indifferent a suitor.&quot;                                          
##  [9275] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9276] &quot;What had really passed between them was to this effect.&quot;                     
##  [9277] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9278] &quot;\&quot;I have heard,\&quot; said he, with great compassion, \&quot;of the injustice your&quot;   
##  [9279] &quot;friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand&quot;        
##  [9280] &quot;the matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering&quot;     
##  [9281] &quot;in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been&quot;          
##  [9282] &quot;rightly informed?--Is it so?--\&quot;&quot;                                            
##  [9283] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9284] &quot;Elinor told him that it was.&quot;                                                
##  [9285] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9286] &quot;\&quot;The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,\&quot;--he replied, with great&quot;             
##  [9287] &quot;feeling,--\&quot;of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long&quot;     
##  [9288] &quot;attached to each other, is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what&quot;      
##  [9289] &quot;she may be doing--what she may drive her son to.  I have seen Mr.&quot;           
##  [9290] &quot;Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with&quot;       
##  [9291] &quot;him.  He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted&quot;      
##  [9292] &quot;in a short time, but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his&quot;     
##  [9293] &quot;own sake, and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.  I understand&quot;     
##  [9294] &quot;that he intends to take orders.  Will you be so good as to tell him&quot;         
##  [9295] &quot;that the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by this&quot;      
##  [9296] &quot;day&#39;s post, is his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but THAT,&quot;          
##  [9297] &quot;perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may be&quot;             
##  [9298] &quot;nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were more  valuable.-- It&quot;       
##  [9299] &quot;is a rectory, but a small one; the late incumbent, I believe, did not&quot;       
##  [9300] &quot;make more than 200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable of&quot;       
##  [9301] &quot;improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as to afford him a very&quot;          
##  [9302] &quot;comfortable income.  Such as it is, however, my pleasure in presenting&quot;      
##  [9303] &quot;it to him, will be very great.  Pray assure him of it.\&quot;&quot;                    
##  [9304] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9305] &quot;Elinor&#39;s astonishment at this commission could hardly have been&quot;             
##  [9306] &quot;greater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand.&quot;       
##  [9307] &quot;The preferment, which only two days before she had considered as&quot;            
##  [9308] &quot;hopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--and&quot;      
##  [9309] &quot;SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!--Her&quot;            
##  [9310] &quot;emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different&quot;        
##  [9311] &quot;cause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might&quot;         
##  [9312] &quot;have a share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,&quot;       
##  [9313] &quot;and her gratitude for the particular friendship, which together&quot;             
##  [9314] &quot;prompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly&quot;        
##  [9315] &quot;expressed.  She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of&quot;             
##  [9316] &quot;Edward&#39;s principles and disposition with that praise which she knew&quot;         
##  [9317] &quot;them to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with&quot;              
##  [9318] &quot;pleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office&quot;      
##  [9319] &quot;to another.  But at the same time, she could not help thinking that no&quot;      
##  [9320] &quot;one could so well perform it as himself.  It was an office in short,&quot;        
##  [9321] &quot;from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an&quot;               
##  [9322] &quot;obligation from HER, she would have been very glad to be spared&quot;             
##  [9323] &quot;herself;-- but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, declining&quot;     
##  [9324] &quot;it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through her&quot;        
##  [9325] &quot;means, that she would not on any account make farther opposition.&quot;           
##  [9326] &quot;Edward, she believed, was still in town, and fortunately she had heard&quot;      
##  [9327] &quot;his address from Miss Steele.  She could undertake therefore to inform&quot;      
##  [9328] &quot;him of it, in the course of the day.  After this had been settled,&quot;          
##  [9329] &quot;Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so&quot;           
##  [9330] &quot;respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and THEN it was that he&quot;              
##  [9331] &quot;mentioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferent;--an&quot;        
##  [9332] &quot;evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very&quot;       
##  [9333] &quot;light of, at least as far as regarded its size.&quot;                             
##  [9334] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9335] &quot;\&quot;The smallness of the house,\&quot; said she, \&quot;I cannot imagine any&quot;            
##  [9336] &quot;inconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family and&quot;     
##  [9337] &quot;income.\&quot;&quot;                                                                   
##  [9338] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9339] &quot;By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr.&quot;     
##  [9340] &quot;Ferrars&#39;s marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation; for&quot;      
##  [9341] &quot;he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such&quot;       
##  [9342] &quot;an income, as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle&quot;          
##  [9343] &quot;on--and he said so.&quot;                                                         
##  [9344] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9345] &quot;\&quot;This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable&quot;      
##  [9346] &quot;as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry.  I am sorry to say that&quot;       
##  [9347] &quot;my patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly more extensive.&quot;      
##  [9348] &quot;If, however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve&quot;      
##  [9349] &quot;him farther, I must think very differently of him from what I now do,&quot;       
##  [9350] &quot;if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I&quot;         
##  [9351] &quot;could be at present.  What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all,&quot;     
##  [9352] &quot;since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal,&quot;      
##  [9353] &quot;his only object of happiness.  His marriage must still be a distant&quot;         
##  [9354] &quot;good;--at least, I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.--\&quot;&quot;            
##  [9355] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9356] &quot;Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended the&quot;     
##  [9357] &quot;delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of what&quot;        
##  [9358] &quot;really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at&quot;       
##  [9359] &quot;the window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may&quot;     
##  [9360] &quot;perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited, nor less&quot;            
##  [9361] &quot;properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage.&quot;            
##  [9362] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9363] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9364] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9365] &quot;CHAPTER 40&quot;                                                                  
##  [9366] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9367] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9368] &quot;\&quot;Well, Miss Dashwood,\&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as soon&quot;   
##  [9369] &quot;as the gentleman had withdrawn, \&quot;I do not ask you what the Colonel has&quot;     
##  [9370] &quot;been saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I TRIED to keep out of&quot;      
##  [9371] &quot;hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand his business.&quot;       
##  [9372] &quot;And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life, and I wish you&quot;      
##  [9373] &quot;joy of it with all my heart.\&quot;&quot;                                              
##  [9374] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9375] &quot;\&quot;Thank you, ma&#39;am,\&quot; said Elinor.  \&quot;It is a matter of great joy to me;&quot;    
##  [9376] &quot;and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly.  There are&quot;        
##  [9377] &quot;not many men who would act as he has done.  Few people who have so&quot;          
##  [9378] &quot;compassionate a heart!  I never was more astonished in my life.\&quot;&quot;           
##  [9379] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9380] &quot;\&quot;Lord! my dear, you are very modest.  I an&#39;t the least astonished at it&quot;    
##  [9381] &quot;in the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more&quot;      
##  [9382] &quot;likely to happen.\&quot;&quot;                                                         
##  [9383] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9384] &quot;\&quot;You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel&#39;s general benevolence;&quot;      
##  [9385] &quot;but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very&quot;       
##  [9386] &quot;soon occur.\&quot;&quot;                                                               
##  [9387] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9388] &quot;\&quot;Opportunity!\&quot; repeated Mrs. Jennings--\&quot;Oh! as to that, when a man has&quot;   
##  [9389] &quot;once made up his mind to such a thing, somehow or other he will soon&quot;        
##  [9390] &quot;find an opportunity.  Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and&quot;         
##  [9391] &quot;again; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think I&quot;         
##  [9392] &quot;shall soon know where to look for them.\&quot;&quot;                                   
##  [9393] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9394] &quot;\&quot;You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,\&quot; said Elinor, with a&quot;    
##  [9395] &quot;faint smile.&quot;                                                                
##  [9396] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9397] &quot;\&quot;Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed.  And as to the house being a bad one,&quot;    
##  [9398] &quot;I do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as&quot;      
##  [9399] &quot;ever I saw.\&quot;&quot;                                                               
##  [9400] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9401] &quot;\&quot;He spoke of its being out of repair.\&quot;&quot;                                    
##  [9402] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9403] &quot;\&quot;Well, and whose fault is that? why don&#39;t he repair it?--who should do&quot;     
##  [9404] &quot;it but himself?\&quot;&quot;                                                           
##  [9405] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9406] &quot;They were interrupted by the servant&#39;s coming in to announce the&quot;            
##  [9407] &quot;carriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to&quot;      
##  [9408] &quot;go, said,--&quot;                                                                 
##  [9409] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9410] &quot;\&quot;Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half my talk out.&quot;         
##  [9411] &quot;But, however, we may have it all over in the evening; for we shall be&quot;       
##  [9412] &quot;quite alone.  I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind&quot;      
##  [9413] &quot;is too full of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must&quot;        
##  [9414] &quot;long to tell your sister all about it.\&quot;&quot;                                    
##  [9415] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9416] &quot;Marianne had left the room before the conversation began.&quot;                   
##  [9417] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9418] &quot;\&quot;Certainly, ma&#39;am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not mention&quot;    
##  [9419] &quot;it at present to any body else.\&quot;&quot;                                           
##  [9420] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9421] &quot;\&quot;Oh! very well,\&quot; said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed.  \&quot;Then you&quot;      
##  [9422] &quot;would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far as&quot;           
##  [9423] &quot;Holborn to-day.\&quot;&quot;                                                           
##  [9424] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9425] &quot;\&quot;No, ma&#39;am, not even Lucy if you please.  One day&#39;s delay will not be&quot;      
##  [9426] &quot;very material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought&quot;     
##  [9427] &quot;not to be mentioned to any body else.  I shall do THAT directly.  It is&quot;     
##  [9428] &quot;of importance that no time should be lost with him, for he will of&quot;          
##  [9429] &quot;course have much to do relative to his ordination.\&quot;&quot;                        
##  [9430] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9431] &quot;This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly.  Why Mr.&quot;            
##  [9432] &quot;Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she could&quot;     
##  [9433] &quot;not immediately comprehend.  A few moments&#39; reflection, however,&quot;            
##  [9434] &quot;produced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed;--&quot;                            
##  [9435] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9436] &quot;\&quot;Oh, ho!--I understand you.  Mr. Ferrars is to be the man.  Well, so&quot;       
##  [9437] &quot;much the better for him.  Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in&quot;            
##  [9438] &quot;readiness; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between&quot;         
##  [9439] &quot;you.  But, my dear, is not this rather out of character?  Should not&quot;        
##  [9440] &quot;the Colonel write himself?--sure, he is the proper person.\&quot;&quot;                
##  [9441] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9442] &quot;Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings&#39;s&quot;            
##  [9443] &quot;speech, neither did she think it worth inquiring into; and therefore&quot;        
##  [9444] &quot;only replied to its conclusion.&quot;                                             
##  [9445] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9446] &quot;\&quot;Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one to&quot;    
##  [9447] &quot;announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself.\&quot;&quot;                      
##  [9448] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9449] &quot;\&quot;And so YOU are forced to do it.  Well THAT is an odd kind of delicacy!&quot;    
##  [9450] &quot;However, I will not disturb you (seeing her preparing to write.)  You&quot;       
##  [9451] &quot;know your own concerns best.  So goodby, my dear.  I have not heard of&quot;      
##  [9452] &quot;any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed.\&quot;&quot;        
##  [9453] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9454] &quot;And away she went; but returning again in a moment,&quot;                         
##  [9455] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9456] &quot;\&quot;I have just been thinking of Betty&#39;s sister, my dear.  I should be&quot;        
##  [9457] &quot;very glad to get her so good a mistress.  But whether she would do for&quot;      
##  [9458] &quot;a lady&#39;s maid, I am sure I can&#39;t tell.  She is an excellent housemaid,&quot;      
##  [9459] &quot;and works very well at her needle.  However, you will think of all that&quot;     
##  [9460] &quot;at your leisure.\&quot;&quot;                                                          
##  [9461] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9462] &quot;\&quot;Certainly, ma&#39;am,\&quot; replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said,&quot;    
##  [9463] &quot;and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.&quot;           
##  [9464] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9465] &quot;How she should begin--how she should express herself in her note to&quot;         
##  [9466] &quot;Edward, was now all her concern.  The particular circumstances between&quot;      
##  [9467] &quot;them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have&quot;         
##  [9468] &quot;been the easiest thing in the world; but she equally feared to say too&quot;      
##  [9469] &quot;much or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the pen&quot;       
##  [9470] &quot;in her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.&quot;           
##  [9471] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9472] &quot;He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as he&quot;      
##  [9473] &quot;came to leave his farewell card; and she, after apologising for not&quot;         
##  [9474] &quot;returning herself, had obliged him to enter, by saying that Miss&quot;            
##  [9475] &quot;Dashwood was above, and wanted to speak with him on very particular&quot;         
##  [9476] &quot;business.&quot;                                                                   
##  [9477] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9478] &quot;Elinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her&quot;            
##  [9479] &quot;perplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself&quot;           
##  [9480] &quot;properly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the&quot;                
##  [9481] &quot;information by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her&quot;        
##  [9482] &quot;upon this greatest exertion of all.  Her astonishment and confusion&quot;         
##  [9483] &quot;were very great on his so sudden appearance.  She had not seen him&quot;          
##  [9484] &quot;before since his engagement became public, and therefore not since his&quot;      
##  [9485] &quot;knowing her to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness of&quot;      
##  [9486] &quot;what she had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made her&quot;       
##  [9487] &quot;feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.  He too was much&quot;          
##  [9488] &quot;distressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state of&quot;         
##  [9489] &quot;embarrassment.--Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on&quot;        
##  [9490] &quot;first coming into the room, he could not recollect; but determining to&quot;      
##  [9491] &quot;be on the safe side, he made his apology in form as soon as he could&quot;        
##  [9492] &quot;say any thing, after taking a chair.&quot;                                        
##  [9493] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9494] &quot;\&quot;Mrs. Jennings told me,\&quot; said he, \&quot;that you wished to speak with me, at&quot;  
##  [9495] &quot;least I understood her so--or I certainly should not have intruded on&quot;       
##  [9496] &quot;you in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have been&quot;           
##  [9497] &quot;extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;&quot;         
##  [9498] &quot;especially as it will most likely be some time--it is not probable that&quot;     
##  [9499] &quot;I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again.  I go to Oxford&quot;       
##  [9500] &quot;tomorrow.\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [9501] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9502] &quot;\&quot;You would not have gone, however,\&quot; said Elinor, recovering herself,&quot;      
##  [9503] &quot;and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as&quot;              
##  [9504] &quot;possible, \&quot;without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been&quot;      
##  [9505] &quot;able to give them in person.  Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she&quot;     
##  [9506] &quot;said.  I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on&quot;     
##  [9507] &quot;the point of communicating by paper.  I am charged with a most&quot;              
##  [9508] &quot;agreeable office (breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke.)&quot;         
##  [9509] &quot;Colonel Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to&quot;       
##  [9510] &quot;say, that understanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasure&quot;      
##  [9511] &quot;in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only wishes&quot;     
##  [9512] &quot;it were more valuable.  Allow me to congratulate you on having so&quot;           
##  [9513] &quot;respectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that the&quot;     
##  [9514] &quot;living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much more considerable,&quot;        
##  [9515] &quot;and such as might better enable you to--as might be more than a&quot;             
##  [9516] &quot;temporary accommodation to yourself--such, in short, as might establish&quot;     
##  [9517] &quot;all your views of happiness.\&quot;&quot;                                              
##  [9518] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9519] &quot;What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself, it cannot be expected&quot;     
##  [9520] &quot;that any one else should say for him.  He LOOKED all the astonishment&quot;       
##  [9521] &quot;which such unexpected, such unthought-of information could not fail of&quot;      
##  [9522] &quot;exciting; but he said only these two words,&quot;                                 
##  [9523] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9524] &quot;\&quot;Colonel Brandon!\&quot;&quot;                                                        
##  [9525] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9526] &quot;\&quot;Yes,\&quot; continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the&quot;        
##  [9527] &quot;worst was over, \&quot;Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern&quot;    
##  [9528] &quot;for what has lately passed--for the cruel situation in which the&quot;            
##  [9529] &quot;unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you--a concern which I&quot;      
##  [9530] &quot;am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share; and&quot;             
##  [9531] &quot;likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character, and&quot;      
##  [9532] &quot;his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion.\&quot;&quot;     
##  [9533] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9534] &quot;\&quot;Colonel Brandon give ME a living!--Can it be possible?\&quot;&quot;                  
##  [9535] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9536] &quot;\&quot;The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find&quot;      
##  [9537] &quot;friendship any where.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##  [9538] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9539] &quot;\&quot;No,\&quot; replied he, with sudden consciousness, \&quot;not to find it in YOU;&quot;     
##  [9540] &quot;for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it&quot;            
##  [9541] &quot;all.--I feel it--I would express it if I could--but, as you well know,&quot;      
##  [9542] &quot;I am no orator.\&quot;&quot;                                                           
##  [9543] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9544] &quot;\&quot;You are very much mistaken.  I do assure you that you owe it entirely,&quot;    
##  [9545] &quot;at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon&#39;s&quot;          
##  [9546] &quot;discernment of it.  I have had no hand in it.  I did not even know,&quot;         
##  [9547] &quot;till I understood his design, that the living was vacant; nor had it&quot;        
##  [9548] &quot;ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift.&quot;       
##  [9549] &quot;As a friend of mine, of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he&quot;        
##  [9550] &quot;HAS, still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owe&quot;     
##  [9551] &quot;nothing to my solicitation.\&quot;&quot;                                               
##  [9552] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9553] &quot;Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action, but&quot;        
##  [9554] &quot;she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of&quot;      
##  [9555] &quot;Edward, that she acknowledged it with hesitation; which probably&quot;            
##  [9556] &quot;contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently&quot;            
##  [9557] &quot;entered it.  For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had&quot;      
##  [9558] &quot;ceased to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,&quot;     
##  [9559] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9560] &quot;\&quot;Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability.  I have&quot;    
##  [9561] &quot;always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems him&quot;     
##  [9562] &quot;highly.  He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners perfectly&quot;     
##  [9563] &quot;the gentleman.\&quot;&quot;                                                            
##  [9564] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9565] &quot;\&quot;Indeed,\&quot; replied Elinor, \&quot;I believe that you will find him, on farther&quot;  
##  [9566] &quot;acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be, and as you will be&quot;         
##  [9567] &quot;such very near neighbours (for I understand the parsonage is almost&quot;         
##  [9568] &quot;close to the mansion-house,) it is particularly important that he&quot;           
##  [9569] &quot;SHOULD be all this.\&quot;&quot;                                                       
##  [9570] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9571] &quot;Edward made no answer; but when she had turned away her head, gave her&quot;      
##  [9572] &quot;a look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he&quot;     
##  [9573] &quot;might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the&quot;             
##  [9574] &quot;mansion-house much greater.&quot;                                                 
##  [9575] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9576] &quot;\&quot;Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street,\&quot; said he, soon&quot;     
##  [9577] &quot;afterwards, rising from his chair.&quot;                                          
##  [9578] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9579] &quot;Elinor told him the number of the house.&quot;                                    
##  [9580] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9581] &quot;\&quot;I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will not&quot;       
##  [9582] &quot;allow me to give YOU; to assure him that he has made me a very--an&quot;          
##  [9583] &quot;exceedingly happy man.\&quot;&quot;                                                    
##  [9584] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9585] &quot;Elinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted, with a very&quot;            
##  [9586] &quot;earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for his&quot;          
##  [9587] &quot;happiness in every change of situation that might befall him; on HIS,&quot;       
##  [9588] &quot;with rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the power of&quot;      
##  [9589] &quot;expressing it.&quot;                                                              
##  [9590] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9591] &quot;\&quot;When I see him again,\&quot; said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him&quot;      
##  [9592] &quot;out, \&quot;I shall see him the husband of Lucy.\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [9593] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9594] &quot;And with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down to reconsider the&quot;         
##  [9595] &quot;past, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of&quot;      
##  [9596] &quot;Edward; and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent.&quot;              
##  [9597] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9598] &quot;When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people&quot;        
##  [9599] &quot;whom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have a&quot;       
##  [9600] &quot;great deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the important&quot;      
##  [9601] &quot;secret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted to&quot;       
##  [9602] &quot;it again as soon as Elinor appeared.&quot;                                        
##  [9603] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9604] &quot;\&quot;Well, my dear,\&quot; she cried, \&quot;I sent you up the young man.  Did not I&quot;     
##  [9605] &quot;do right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty--You did not find&quot;      
##  [9606] &quot;him very unwilling to accept your proposal?\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [9607] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9608] &quot;\&quot;No, ma&#39;am; THAT was not very likely.\&quot;&quot;                                    
##  [9609] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9610] &quot;\&quot;Well, and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon&quot;     
##  [9611] &quot;that.\&quot;&quot;                                                                     
##  [9612] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9613] &quot;\&quot;Really,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;I know so little of these kind of forms, that I&quot;  
##  [9614] &quot;can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation&quot;               
##  [9615] &quot;necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his&quot;              
##  [9616] &quot;ordination.\&quot;&quot;                                                               
##  [9617] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9618] &quot;\&quot;Two or three months!\&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings; \&quot;Lord! my dear, how calmly&quot;   
##  [9619] &quot;you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord&quot;          
##  [9620] &quot;bless me!--I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!--And though&quot;     
##  [9621] &quot;one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think&quot;     
##  [9622] &quot;it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him.  Sure&quot;            
##  [9623] &quot;somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that is in&quot;     
##  [9624] &quot;orders already.\&quot;&quot;                                                           
##  [9625] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9626] &quot;\&quot;My dear ma&#39;am,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;what can you be thinking of?-- Why,&quot;       
##  [9627] &quot;Colonel Brandon&#39;s only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\&quot;&quot;             
##  [9628] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9629] &quot;\&quot;Lord bless you, my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the&quot;    
##  [9630] &quot;Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr.&quot;          
##  [9631] &quot;Ferrars!\&quot;&quot;                                                                  
##  [9632] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9633] &quot;The deception could not continue after this; and an explanation&quot;             
##  [9634] &quot;immediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement for&quot;     
##  [9635] &quot;the moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs.&quot;      
##  [9636] &quot;Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and still&quot;          
##  [9637] &quot;without forfeiting her expectation of the first.&quot;                            
##  [9638] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9639] &quot;\&quot;Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,\&quot; said she, after the first&quot;   
##  [9640] &quot;ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, \&quot;and very likely MAY&quot;     
##  [9641] &quot;be out of repair; but to hear a man apologising, as I thought, for a&quot;        
##  [9642] &quot;house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor,&quot;      
##  [9643] &quot;and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!--and to&quot;     
##  [9644] &quot;you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage!-- It seems quite&quot;     
##  [9645] &quot;ridiculous.  But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to do some&quot;          
##  [9646] &quot;thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy&quot;       
##  [9647] &quot;goes to it.\&quot;&quot;                                                               
##  [9648] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9649] &quot;\&quot;But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living&#39;s&quot;        
##  [9650] &quot;being enough to allow them to marry.\&quot;&quot;                                      
##  [9651] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9652] &quot;\&quot;The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-year&quot;       
##  [9653] &quot;himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less.  Take my word&quot;        
##  [9654] &quot;for it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford&quot;          
##  [9655] &quot;Parsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan&#39;t go if Lucy an&#39;t&quot;         
##  [9656] &quot;there.\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
##  [9657] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9658] &quot;Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability of their not&quot;         
##  [9659] &quot;waiting for any thing more.&quot;                                                 
##  [9660] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9661] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9662] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9663] &quot;CHAPTER 41&quot;                                                                  
##  [9664] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9665] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9666] &quot;Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with&quot;        
##  [9667] &quot;his happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he&quot;         
##  [9668] &quot;reached Bartlett&#39;s Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs.&quot;              
##  [9669] &quot;Jennings, who called on her again the next day with her&quot;                     
##  [9670] &quot;congratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before in&quot;      
##  [9671] &quot;her life.&quot;                                                                   
##  [9672] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9673] &quot;Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were at least very certain; and&quot;     
##  [9674] &quot;she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their&quot;          
##  [9675] &quot;being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.&quot;     
##  [9676] &quot;So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness to give Elinor&quot;      
##  [9677] &quot;that credit which Edward WOULD give her, that she spoke of her&quot;              
##  [9678] &quot;friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was ready to&quot;        
##  [9679] &quot;own all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no exertion&quot;       
##  [9680] &quot;for their good on Miss Dashwood&#39;s part, either present or future, would&quot;     
##  [9681] &quot;ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing any thing in&quot;       
##  [9682] &quot;the world for those she really valued.  As for Colonel Brandon, she was&quot;     
##  [9683] &quot;not only ready to worship him as a saint, but was moreover truly&quot;            
##  [9684] &quot;anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;&quot;           
##  [9685] &quot;anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and scarcely&quot;        
##  [9686] &quot;resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she possibly could,&quot;       
##  [9687] &quot;of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his poultry.&quot;                   
##  [9688] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9689] &quot;It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley&quot;          
##  [9690] &quot;Street, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his&quot;      
##  [9691] &quot;wife&#39;s indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel&quot;       
##  [9692] &quot;it necessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation, however,&quot;          
##  [9693] &quot;which not only opposed her own inclination, but which had not the&quot;           
##  [9694] &quot;assistance of any encouragement from her companions.  Marianne, not&quot;         
##  [9695] &quot;contented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to&quot;        
##  [9696] &quot;prevent her sister&#39;s going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her&quot;            
##  [9697] &quot;carriage was always at Elinor&#39;s service, so very much disliked Mrs.&quot;         
##  [9698] &quot;John Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after&quot;      
##  [9699] &quot;the late discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking&quot;          
##  [9700] &quot;Edward&#39;s part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company&quot;        
##  [9701] &quot;again.  The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a&quot;        
##  [9702] &quot;visit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run&quot;      
##  [9703] &quot;the risk of a tete-a-tete with a woman, whom neither of the others had&quot;      
##  [9704] &quot;so much reason to dislike.&quot;                                                  
##  [9705] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9706] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the&quot;       
##  [9707] &quot;house, her husband accidentally came out.  He expressed great pleasure&quot;      
##  [9708] &quot;in meeting Elinor, told her that he had been just going to call in&quot;          
##  [9709] &quot;Berkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see&quot;     
##  [9710] &quot;her, invited her to come in.&quot;                                                
##  [9711] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9712] &quot;They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--Nobody was there.&quot;            
##  [9713] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9714] &quot;\&quot;Fanny is in her own room, I suppose,\&quot; said he:--\&quot;I will go to her&quot;       
##  [9715] &quot;presently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the&quot;       
##  [9716] &quot;world to seeing YOU.-- Very far from it, indeed.  NOW especially there&quot;      
##  [9717] &quot;cannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always great&quot;                  
##  [9718] &quot;favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?\&quot;--&quot;                               
##  [9719] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9720] &quot;Elinor made what excuse she could for her.&quot;                                  
##  [9721] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9722] &quot;\&quot;I am not sorry to see you alone,\&quot; he replied, \&quot;for I have a good deal&quot;   
##  [9723] &quot;to say to you.  This living of Colonel Brandon&#39;s--can it be true?--has&quot;      
##  [9724] &quot;he really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was&quot;      
##  [9725] &quot;coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.\&quot;&quot;                     
##  [9726] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9727] &quot;\&quot;It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given the living of&quot;            
##  [9728] &quot;Delaford to Edward.\&quot;&quot;                                                       
##  [9729] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9730] &quot;\&quot;Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no&quot;            
##  [9731] &quot;connection between them!--and now that livings fetch such a&quot;                 
##  [9732] &quot;price!--what was the value of this?\&quot;&quot;                                       
##  [9733] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9734] &quot;\&quot;About two hundred a year.\&quot;&quot;                                               
##  [9735] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9736] &quot;\&quot;Very well--and for the next presentation to a living of that&quot;              
##  [9737] &quot;value--supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and&quot;        
##  [9738] &quot;likely to vacate it soon--he might have got I dare say--fourteen&quot;            
##  [9739] &quot;hundred pounds.  And how came he not to have settled that matter before&quot;     
##  [9740] &quot;this person&#39;s death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it, but a&quot;     
##  [9741] &quot;man of Colonel Brandon&#39;s sense!--I wonder he should be so improvident&quot;       
##  [9742] &quot;in a point of such common, such natural, concern!--Well, I am convinced&quot;     
##  [9743] &quot;that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human&quot;            
##  [9744] &quot;character.  I suppose, however--on recollection--that the case may&quot;          
##  [9745] &quot;probably be THIS.  Edward is only to hold the living till the person to&quot;     
##  [9746] &quot;whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough to&quot;         
##  [9747] &quot;take it.--Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.\&quot;&quot;                     
##  [9748] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9749] &quot;Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that&quot;      
##  [9750] &quot;she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel&quot;           
##  [9751] &quot;Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which&quot;       
##  [9752] &quot;it was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.&quot;                       
##  [9753] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9754] &quot;\&quot;It is truly astonishing!\&quot;--he cried, after hearing what she&quot;              
##  [9755] &quot;said--\&quot;what could be the Colonel&#39;s motive?\&quot;&quot;                               
##  [9756] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9757] &quot;\&quot;A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\&quot;&quot;                         
##  [9758] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9759] &quot;\&quot;Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky&quot;       
##  [9760] &quot;man.--You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I&quot;       
##  [9761] &quot;have broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like&quot;      
##  [9762] &quot;to hear it much talked of.\&quot;&quot;                                                
##  [9763] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9764] &quot;Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she&quot;         
##  [9765] &quot;thought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of wealth&quot;     
##  [9766] &quot;to her brother, by which neither she nor her child could be possibly&quot;        
##  [9767] &quot;impoverished.&quot;                                                               
##  [9768] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9769] &quot;\&quot;Mrs. Ferrars,\&quot; added he, lowering his voice to the tone becoming so&quot;      
##  [9770] &quot;important a subject, \&quot;knows nothing about it at present, and I believe&quot;     
##  [9771] &quot;it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may&quot;       
##  [9772] &quot;be.-- When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all.\&quot;&quot;      
##  [9773] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9774] &quot;\&quot;But why should such precaution be used?--Though it is not to be&quot;           
##  [9775] &quot;supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in&quot;            
##  [9776] &quot;knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be&quot;       
##  [9777] &quot;quite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she&quot;         
##  [9778] &quot;supposed to feel at all?--She has done with her son, she cast him off&quot;       
##  [9779] &quot;for ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast&quot;      
##  [9780] &quot;him off likewise.  Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined&quot;           
##  [9781] &quot;liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--she cannot&quot;     
##  [9782] &quot;be interested in any thing that befalls him.-- She would not be so weak&quot;     
##  [9783] &quot;as to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of&quot;      
##  [9784] &quot;a parent!\&quot;&quot;                                                                 
##  [9785] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9786] &quot;\&quot;Ah! Elinor,\&quot; said John, \&quot;your reasoning is very good, but it is&quot;         
##  [9787] &quot;founded on ignorance of human nature.  When Edward&#39;s unhappy match&quot;          
##  [9788] &quot;takes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had&quot;      
##  [9789] &quot;never discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may&quot;             
##  [9790] &quot;accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as&quot;       
##  [9791] &quot;possible.  Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.\&quot;&quot;          
##  [9792] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9793] &quot;\&quot;You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory&quot;    
##  [9794] &quot;by THIS time.\&quot;&quot;                                                             
##  [9795] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9796] &quot;\&quot;You wrong her exceedingly.  Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most&quot;               
##  [9797] &quot;affectionate mothers in the world.\&quot;&quot;                                        
##  [9798] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9799] &quot;Elinor was silent.&quot;                                                          
##  [9800] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9801] &quot;\&quot;We think NOW,\&quot;--said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, \&quot;of ROBERT&#39;S&quot;    
##  [9802] &quot;marrying Miss Morton.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
##  [9803] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9804] &quot;Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother&#39;s&quot;       
##  [9805] &quot;tone, calmly replied,&quot;                                                       
##  [9806] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9807] &quot;\&quot;The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.\&quot;&quot;                       
##  [9808] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9809] &quot;\&quot;Choice!--how do you mean?\&quot;&quot;                                               
##  [9810] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9811] &quot;\&quot;I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be&quot;      
##  [9812] &quot;the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert.\&quot;&quot;               
##  [9813] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9814] &quot;\&quot;Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all&quot;         
##  [9815] &quot;intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;--and as to any&quot;        
##  [9816] &quot;thing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that&quot;      
##  [9817] &quot;one is superior to the other.\&quot;&quot;                                             
##  [9818] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9819] &quot;Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent.--His&quot;        
##  [9820] &quot;reflections ended thus.&quot;                                                     
##  [9821] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9822] &quot;\&quot;Of ONE thing, my dear sister,\&quot; kindly taking her hand, and speaking in&quot;   
##  [9823] &quot;an awful whisper,--\&quot;I may assure you;--and I WILL do it, because I know&quot;    
##  [9824] &quot;it must gratify you.  I have good reason to think--indeed I have it&quot;         
##  [9825] &quot;from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise it&quot;        
##  [9826] &quot;would be very wrong to say any thing about it--but I have it from the&quot;       
##  [9827] &quot;very best authority--not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say&quot;       
##  [9828] &quot;it herself--but her daughter DID, and I have it from her--That in&quot;           
##  [9829] &quot;short, whatever objections there might be against a certain--a certain&quot;      
##  [9830] &quot;connection--you understand me--it would have been far preferable to&quot;         
##  [9831] &quot;her, it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does.  I&quot;       
##  [9832] &quot;was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that&quot;     
##  [9833] &quot;light--a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all.  &#39;It would&quot;        
##  [9834] &quot;have been beyond comparison,&#39; she said, &#39;the least evil of the two, and&quot;     
##  [9835] &quot;she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse.&#39; But however, all&quot;      
##  [9836] &quot;that is quite out of the question--not to be thought of or&quot;                  
##  [9837] &quot;mentioned--as to any attachment you know--it never could be--all that&quot;       
##  [9838] &quot;is gone by.  But I thought I would just tell you of this, because I&quot;         
##  [9839] &quot;knew how much it must please you.  Not that you have any reason to&quot;          
##  [9840] &quot;regret, my dear Elinor.  There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly&quot;        
##  [9841] &quot;well--quite as well, or better, perhaps, all things considered.  Has&quot;        
##  [9842] &quot;Colonel Brandon been with you lately?\&quot;&quot;                                     
##  [9843] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9844] &quot;Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity, and raise her&quot;        
##  [9845] &quot;self-importance, to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;--and she was&quot;      
##  [9846] &quot;therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply&quot;      
##  [9847] &quot;herself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her&quot;             
##  [9848] &quot;brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars.  After a few moments&#39;&quot;       
##  [9849] &quot;chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her&quot;      
##  [9850] &quot;sister&#39;s being there, quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was&quot;      
##  [9851] &quot;left to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay&quot;               
##  [9852] &quot;unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so&quot;       
##  [9853] &quot;unfair a division of his mother&#39;s love and liberality, to the prejudice&quot;     
##  [9854] &quot;of his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated course of&quot;        
##  [9855] &quot;life, and that brother&#39;s integrity, was confirming her most&quot;                 
##  [9856] &quot;unfavourable opinion of his head and heart.&quot;                                 
##  [9857] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9858] &quot;They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he began to&quot;        
##  [9859] &quot;speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard of the living, and was very&quot;         
##  [9860] &quot;inquisitive on the subject.  Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as&quot;      
##  [9861] &quot;she had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very&quot;         
##  [9862] &quot;different, was not less striking than it had been on HIM.  He laughed&quot;       
##  [9863] &quot;most immoderately.  The idea of Edward&#39;s being a clergyman, and living&quot;      
##  [9864] &quot;in a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;--and when to&quot;       
##  [9865] &quot;that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a&quot;          
##  [9866] &quot;white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith&quot;     
##  [9867] &quot;and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.&quot;                  
##  [9868] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9869] &quot;Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, the&quot;              
##  [9870] &quot;conclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from being fixed&quot;      
##  [9871] &quot;on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited.  It was a&quot;        
##  [9872] &quot;look, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings,&quot;        
##  [9873] &quot;and gave no intelligence to him.  He was recalled from wit to wisdom,&quot;       
##  [9874] &quot;not by any reproof of hers, but by his own sensibility.&quot;                     
##  [9875] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9876] &quot;\&quot;We may treat it as a joke,\&quot; said he, at last, recovering from the&quot;        
##  [9877] &quot;affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety&quot;     
##  [9878] &quot;of the moment--\&quot;but, upon my soul, it is a most serious business.  Poor&quot;    
##  [9879] &quot;Edward!  he is ruined for ever.  I am extremely sorry for it--for I&quot;         
##  [9880] &quot;know him to be a very good-hearted creature; as well-meaning a fellow&quot;       
##  [9881] &quot;perhaps, as any in the world.  You must not judge of him, Miss&quot;              
##  [9882] &quot;Dashwood, from YOUR slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are&quot;     
##  [9883] &quot;certainly not the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born, you&quot;         
##  [9884] &quot;know, with the same powers,--the same address.-- Poor fellow!--to see&quot;       
##  [9885] &quot;him in a circle of strangers!--to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but&quot;      
##  [9886] &quot;upon my soul, I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom;&quot;       
##  [9887] &quot;and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life, as&quot;      
##  [9888] &quot;when it all burst forth.  I could not believe it.-- My mother was the&quot;       
##  [9889] &quot;first person who told me of it; and I, feeling myself called on to act&quot;      
##  [9890] &quot;with resolution, immediately said to her, &#39;My dear madam, I do not know&quot;     
##  [9891] &quot;what you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself, I must&quot;        
##  [9892] &quot;say, that if Edward does marry this young woman, I never will see him&quot;       
##  [9893] &quot;again.&#39; That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonly&quot;           
##  [9894] &quot;shocked, indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has done for himself&quot;                     
##  [9895] &quot;completely--shut himself out for ever from all decent society!--but, as&quot;     
##  [9896] &quot;I directly said to my mother, I am not in the least surprised at it;&quot;        
##  [9897] &quot;from his style of education, it was always to be expected.  My poor&quot;         
##  [9898] &quot;mother was half frantic.\&quot;&quot;                                                  
##  [9899] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9900] &quot;\&quot;Have you ever seen the lady?\&quot;&quot;                                            
##  [9901] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9902] &quot;\&quot;Yes; once, while she was staying in this house, I happened to drop in&quot;     
##  [9903] &quot;for ten minutes; and I saw quite enough of her.  The merest awkward&quot;         
##  [9904] &quot;country girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty.--&quot;      
##  [9905] &quot;I remember her perfectly.  Just the kind of girl I should suppose&quot;           
##  [9906] &quot;likely to captivate poor Edward.  I offered immediately, as soon as my&quot;      
##  [9907] &quot;mother related the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade&quot;        
##  [9908] &quot;him from the match; but it was too late THEN, I found, to do any thing,&quot;     
##  [9909] &quot;for unluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of it&quot;        
##  [9910] &quot;till after the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, you&quot;          
##  [9911] &quot;know, to interfere.  But had I been informed of it a few hours&quot;              
##  [9912] &quot;earlier--I think it is most probable--that something might have been&quot;        
##  [9913] &quot;hit on.  I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very&quot;         
##  [9914] &quot;strong light.  &#39;My dear fellow,&#39; I should have said, &#39;consider what you&quot;     
##  [9915] &quot;are doing.  You are making a most disgraceful connection, and such a&quot;        
##  [9916] &quot;one as your family are unanimous in disapproving.&#39; I cannot help&quot;            
##  [9917] &quot;thinking, in short, that means might have been found.  But now it is&quot;        
##  [9918] &quot;all too late.  He must be starved, you know;--that is certain;&quot;              
##  [9919] &quot;absolutely starved.\&quot;&quot;                                                       
##  [9920] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9921] &quot;He had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance&quot;      
##  [9922] &quot;of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject.  But though SHE never&quot;      
##  [9923] &quot;spoke of it out of her own family, Elinor could see its influence on&quot;        
##  [9924] &quot;her mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which she&quot;     
##  [9925] &quot;entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself.  She&quot;     
##  [9926] &quot;even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her&quot;        
##  [9927] &quot;sister were so soon to leave town, as she had hoped to see more of&quot;          
##  [9928] &quot;them;--an exertion in which her husband, who attended her into the&quot;          
##  [9929] &quot;room, and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish every&quot;      
##  [9930] &quot;thing that was most affectionate and graceful.&quot;                              
##  [9931] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9932] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9933] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9934] &quot;CHAPTER 42&quot;                                                                  
##  [9935] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9936] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9937] &quot;One other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor received her&quot;         
##  [9938] &quot;brother&#39;s congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton&quot;         
##  [9939] &quot;without any expense, and on Colonel Brandon&#39;s being to follow them to&quot;       
##  [9940] &quot;Cleveland in a day or two, completed the intercourse of the brother and&quot;     
##  [9941] &quot;sisters in town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to Norland&quot;     
##  [9942] &quot;whenever it should happen to be in their way, which of all things was&quot;       
##  [9943] &quot;the most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less public,&quot;           
##  [9944] &quot;assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he should&quot;     
##  [9945] &quot;come to see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any meeting in the&quot;       
##  [9946] &quot;country.&quot;                                                                    
##  [9947] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9948] &quot;It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send&quot;     
##  [9949] &quot;her to Delaford;--a place, in which, of all others, she would now least&quot;     
##  [9950] &quot;chuse to visit, or wish to reside; for not only was it considered as&quot;        
##  [9951] &quot;her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy, when&quot;       
##  [9952] &quot;they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there.&quot;             
##  [9953] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9954] &quot;Very early in April, and tolerably early in the day, the two parties&quot;        
##  [9955] &quot;from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective&quot;       
##  [9956] &quot;homes, to meet, by appointment, on the road.  For the convenience of&quot;        
##  [9957] &quot;Charlotte and her child, they were to be more than two days on their&quot;        
##  [9958] &quot;journey, and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel&quot;         
##  [9959] &quot;Brandon, was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.&quot;            
##  [9960] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9961] &quot;Marianne, few as had been her hours of comfort in London, and eager as&quot;      
##  [9962] &quot;she had long been to quit it, could not, when it came to the point, bid&quot;     
##  [9963] &quot;adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those&quot;         
##  [9964] &quot;hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby, which were now extinguished&quot;      
##  [9965] &quot;for ever, without great pain.  Nor could she leave the place in which&quot;       
##  [9966] &quot;Willoughby remained, busy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which&quot;     
##  [9967] &quot;SHE could have no share, without shedding many tears.&quot;                       
##  [9968] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9969] &quot;Elinor&#39;s satisfaction, at the moment of removal, was more positive.&quot;         
##  [9970] &quot;She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on, she left&quot;       
##  [9971] &quot;no creature behind, from whom it would give her a moment&#39;s regret to be&quot;     
##  [9972] &quot;divided for ever, she was pleased to be free herself from the&quot;               
##  [9973] &quot;persecution of Lucy&#39;s friendship, she was grateful for bringing her&quot;         
##  [9974] &quot;sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage, and she looked&quot;         
##  [9975] &quot;forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might&quot;       
##  [9976] &quot;do towards restoring Marianne&#39;s peace of mind, and confirming her own.&quot;      
##  [9977] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9978] &quot;Their journey was safely performed.  The second day brought them into&quot;       
##  [9979] &quot;the cherished, or the prohibited, county of Somerset, for as such was&quot;       
##  [9980] &quot;it dwelt on by turns in Marianne&#39;s imagination; and in the forenoon of&quot;      
##  [9981] &quot;the third they drove up to Cleveland.&quot;                                       
##  [9982] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9983] &quot;Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built house, situated on a sloping&quot;         
##  [9984] &quot;lawn.  It had no park, but the pleasure-grounds were tolerably&quot;              
##  [9985] &quot;extensive; and like every other place of the same degree of importance,&quot;     
##  [9986] &quot;it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of smooth&quot;           
##  [9987] &quot;gravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn was&quot;           
##  [9988] &quot;dotted over with timber, the house itself was under the guardianship of&quot;     
##  [9989] &quot;the fir, the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of them&quot;       
##  [9990] &quot;altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars, shut out the&quot;           
##  [9991] &quot;offices.&quot;                                                                    
##  [9992] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
##  [9993] &quot;Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the&quot;      
##  [9994] &quot;consciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton, and not thirty&quot;        
##  [9995] &quot;from Combe Magna; and before she had been five minutes within its&quot;           
##  [9996] &quot;walls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her child&quot;     
##  [9997] &quot;to the housekeeper, she quitted it again, stealing away through the&quot;         
##  [9998] &quot;winding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain a&quot;          
##  [9999] &quot;distant eminence; where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering&quot;        
## [10000] &quot;over a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest on&quot;        
## [10001] &quot;the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from their&quot;       
## [10002] &quot;summits Combe Magna might be seen.&quot;                                          
## [10003] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10004] &quot;In such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she rejoiced in tears&quot;       
## [10005] &quot;of agony to be at Cleveland; and as she returned by a different circuit&quot;     
## [10006] &quot;to the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty, of&quot;        
## [10007] &quot;wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude, she&quot;           
## [10008] &quot;resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained&quot;         
## [10009] &quot;with the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary rambles.&quot;               
## [10010] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10011] &quot;She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house,&quot;     
## [10012] &quot;on an excursion through its more immediate premises; and the rest of&quot;        
## [10013] &quot;the morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen&quot;           
## [10014] &quot;garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the&quot;            
## [10015] &quot;gardener&#39;s lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the&quot;               
## [10016] &quot;green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants, unwarily exposed,&quot;      
## [10017] &quot;and nipped by the lingering frost, raised the laughter of&quot;                   
## [10018] &quot;Charlotte,--and in visiting her poultry-yard, where, in the&quot;                 
## [10019] &quot;disappointed hopes of her dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, or&quot;     
## [10020] &quot;being stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising young&quot;        
## [10021] &quot;brood, she found fresh sources of merriment.&quot;                                
## [10022] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10023] &quot;The morning was fine and dry, and Marianne, in her plan of employment&quot;       
## [10024] &quot;abroad, had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay&quot;      
## [10025] &quot;at Cleveland.  With great surprise therefore, did she find herself&quot;          
## [10026] &quot;prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner.  She had&quot;     
## [10027] &quot;depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhaps all over&quot;     
## [10028] &quot;the grounds, and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred&quot;     
## [10029] &quot;her from it; but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry&quot;      
## [10030] &quot;or pleasant weather for walking.&quot;                                            
## [10031] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10032] &quot;Their party was small, and the hours passed quietly away.  Mrs. Palmer&quot;      
## [10033] &quot;had her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work; they talked of the&quot;        
## [10034] &quot;friends they had left behind, arranged Lady Middleton&#39;s engagements,&quot;        
## [10035] &quot;and wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther&quot;       
## [10036] &quot;than Reading that night.  Elinor, however little concerned in it,&quot;           
## [10037] &quot;joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had the knack of finding&quot;       
## [10038] &quot;her way in every house to the library, however it might be avoided by&quot;       
## [10039] &quot;the family in general, soon procured herself a book.&quot;                        
## [10040] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10041] &quot;Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer&#39;s side that constant and friendly&quot;        
## [10042] &quot;good humour could do, to make them feel themselves welcome.  The&quot;            
## [10043] &quot;openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of&quot;     
## [10044] &quot;recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms&quot;       
## [10045] &quot;of politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty a face, was&quot;           
## [10046] &quot;engaging; her folly, though evident was not disgusting, because it was&quot;      
## [10047] &quot;not conceited; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh.&quot;    
## [10048] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10049] &quot;The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner, affording&quot;     
## [10050] &quot;a pleasant enlargement of the party, and a very welcome variety to&quot;          
## [10051] &quot;their conversation, which a long morning of the same continued rain had&quot;     
## [10052] &quot;reduced very low.&quot;                                                           
## [10053] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10054] &quot;Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that little had seen so&quot;     
## [10055] &quot;much variety in his address to her sister and herself, that she knew&quot;        
## [10056] &quot;not what to expect to find him in his own family.  She found him,&quot;           
## [10057] &quot;however, perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,&quot;      
## [10058] &quot;and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother; she found him&quot;        
## [10059] &quot;very capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from&quot;         
## [10060] &quot;being so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much&quot;          
## [10061] &quot;superior to people in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs.&quot;        
## [10062] &quot;Jennings and Charlotte.  For the rest of his character and habits, they&quot;     
## [10063] &quot;were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all&quot;         
## [10064] &quot;unusual in his sex and time of life.  He was nice in his eating,&quot;            
## [10065] &quot;uncertain in his hours; fond of his child, though affecting to slight&quot;       
## [10066] &quot;it; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been&quot;      
## [10067] &quot;devoted to business.  She liked him, however, upon the whole, much&quot;          
## [10068] &quot;better than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that she&quot;       
## [10069] &quot;could like him no more;--not sorry to be driven by the observation of&quot;       
## [10070] &quot;his Epicurism, his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with&quot;               
## [10071] &quot;complacency on the remembrance of Edward&#39;s generous temper, simple&quot;          
## [10072] &quot;taste, and diffident feelings.&quot;                                              
## [10073] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10074] &quot;Of Edward, or at least of some of his concerns, she now received&quot;            
## [10075] &quot;intelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire&quot;            
## [10076] &quot;lately; and who, treating her at once as the disinterested friend of&quot;        
## [10077] &quot;Mr. Ferrars, and the kind confidante of himself, talked to her a&quot;            
## [10078] &quot;great deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies,&quot;        
## [10079] &quot;and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them.--His&quot;        
## [10080] &quot;behaviour to her in this, as well as in every other particular, his&quot;         
## [10081] &quot;open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days, his&quot;         
## [10082] &quot;readiness to converse with her, and his deference for her opinion,&quot;          
## [10083] &quot;might very well justify Mrs. Jennings&#39;s persuasion of his attachment,&quot;       
## [10084] &quot;and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the&quot;      
## [10085] &quot;first, believed Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it&quot;         
## [10086] &quot;herself.  But as it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her&quot;        
## [10087] &quot;head, except by Mrs. Jennings&#39;s suggestion; and she could not help&quot;          
## [10088] &quot;believing herself the nicest observer of the two;--she watched his&quot;          
## [10089] &quot;eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour;--and while his&quot;     
## [10090] &quot;looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne&#39;s feeling, in her head and&quot;          
## [10091] &quot;throat, the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,&quot;        
## [10092] &quot;entirely escaped the latter lady&#39;s observation;--SHE could discover in&quot;      
## [10093] &quot;them the quick feelings, and needless alarm of a lover.&quot;                     
## [10094] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10095] &quot;Two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her&quot;       
## [10096] &quot;being there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but all&quot;         
## [10097] &quot;over the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them,&quot;         
## [10098] &quot;where there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where the&quot;      
## [10099] &quot;trees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,&quot;           
## [10100] &quot;had--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet&quot;         
## [10101] &quot;shoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a&quot;      
## [10102] &quot;day or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing&quot;         
## [10103] &quot;ailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.&quot;           
## [10104] &quot;Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual, were all&quot;           
## [10105] &quot;declined.  Though heavy and feverish, with a pain in her limbs, and a&quot;       
## [10106] &quot;cough, and a sore throat, a good night&#39;s rest was to cure her entirely;&quot;     
## [10107] &quot;and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her, when she went&quot;      
## [10108] &quot;to bed, to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies.&quot;                  
## [10109] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10110] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10111] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10112] &quot;CHAPTER 43&quot;                                                                  
## [10113] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10114] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10115] &quot;Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time; to every inquiry&quot;        
## [10116] &quot;replied that she was better, and tried to prove herself so, by engaging&quot;     
## [10117] &quot;in her accustomary employments.  But a day spent in sitting shivering&quot;       
## [10118] &quot;over the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable to read, or&quot;     
## [10119] &quot;in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much in favour of&quot;     
## [10120] &quot;her amendment; and when, at last, she went early to bed, more and more&quot;      
## [10121] &quot;indisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister&#39;s&quot;             
## [10122] &quot;composure, who, though attending and nursing her the whole day, against&quot;     
## [10123] &quot;Marianne&#39;s inclination, and forcing proper medicines on her at night,&quot;       
## [10124] &quot;trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of sleep, and&quot;         
## [10125] &quot;felt no real alarm.&quot;                                                         
## [10126] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10127] &quot;A very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed the&quot;               
## [10128] &quot;expectation of both; and when Marianne, after persisting in rising,&quot;         
## [10129] &quot;confessed herself unable to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her&quot;         
## [10130] &quot;bed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings&#39;s advice, of sending&quot;      
## [10131] &quot;for the Palmers&#39; apothecary.&quot;                                                
## [10132] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10133] &quot;He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to&quot;      
## [10134] &quot;expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health, yet, by&quot;     
## [10135] &quot;pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing the&quot;        
## [10136] &quot;word \&quot;infection\&quot; to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,&quot;     
## [10137] &quot;on her baby&#39;s account.  Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined from the&quot;       
## [10138] &quot;first to think Marianne&#39;s complaint more serious than Elinor, now&quot;           
## [10139] &quot;looked very grave on Mr. Harris&#39;s report, and confirming Charlotte&#39;s&quot;        
## [10140] &quot;fears and caution, urged the necessity of her immediate removal with&quot;        
## [10141] &quot;her infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as&quot;          
## [10142] &quot;idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be&quot;         
## [10143] &quot;withstood.  Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and within an hour&quot;      
## [10144] &quot;after Mr. Harris&#39;s arrival, she set off, with her little boy and his&quot;        
## [10145] &quot;nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer&#39;s, who lived a&quot;        
## [10146] &quot;few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised, at&quot;       
## [10147] &quot;her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two; and whither she was&quot;      
## [10148] &quot;almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her.  Mrs. Jennings,&quot;     
## [10149] &quot;however, with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her,&quot;        
## [10150] &quot;declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as&quot;           
## [10151] &quot;Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring, by her own attentive care,&quot;      
## [10152] &quot;to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from; and&quot;        
## [10153] &quot;Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,&quot;      
## [10154] &quot;desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her better&quot;              
## [10155] &quot;experience in nursing, of material use.&quot;                                     
## [10156] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10157] &quot;Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, and&quot;           
## [10158] &quot;feeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow&quot;         
## [10159] &quot;would find her recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have&quot;          
## [10160] &quot;produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for&quot;      
## [10161] &quot;on that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended&quot;       
## [10162] &quot;the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their&quot;       
## [10163] &quot;mother by surprise on the following forenoon.  The little she said was&quot;      
## [10164] &quot;all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to&quot;         
## [10165] &quot;raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN really believed&quot;        
## [10166] &quot;herself, that it would be a very short one.&quot;                                 
## [10167] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10168] &quot;The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the&quot;           
## [10169] &quot;patient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was no&quot;        
## [10170] &quot;amendment, did not appear worse.  Their party was now farther reduced;&quot;      
## [10171] &quot;for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity&quot;      
## [10172] &quot;and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away&quot;       
## [10173] &quot;by his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his&quot;        
## [10174] &quot;promise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel&quot;         
## [10175] &quot;Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going&quot;       
## [10176] &quot;likewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most&quot;     
## [10177] &quot;acceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much&quot;      
## [10178] &quot;uneasiness on her sister&#39;s account, would be to deprive them both, she&quot;      
## [10179] &quot;thought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that his&quot;       
## [10180] &quot;stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him to&quot;     
## [10181] &quot;play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with her&quot;        
## [10182] &quot;sister, &amp;c. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was&quot;           
## [10183] &quot;gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not&quot;       
## [10184] &quot;long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings&#39;s entreaty was&quot;       
## [10185] &quot;warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself,&quot;      
## [10186] &quot;in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss&quot;        
## [10187] &quot;Dashwood in any emergence.&quot;                                                  
## [10188] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10189] &quot;Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements.&quot;       
## [10190] &quot;She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of&quot;           
## [10191] &quot;Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival.  It&quot;     
## [10192] &quot;gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it&quot;         
## [10193] &quot;gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name.&quot;                 
## [10194] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10195] &quot;Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer&#39;s departure, and her&quot;       
## [10196] &quot;situation continued, with little variation, the same.  Mr. Harris, who&quot;      
## [10197] &quot;attended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and&quot;       
## [10198] &quot;Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others&quot;       
## [10199] &quot;was by no means so cheerful.  Mrs. Jennings had determined very early&quot;       
## [10200] &quot;in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel&quot;           
## [10201] &quot;Brandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings&#39;s&quot;             
## [10202] &quot;forebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence.  He&quot;      
## [10203] &quot;tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment of&quot;       
## [10204] &quot;the apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each day&quot;      
## [10205] &quot;in which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the&quot;        
## [10206] &quot;admission of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from his&quot;         
## [10207] &quot;mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.&quot;                    
## [10208] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10209] &quot;On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of&quot;        
## [10210] &quot;both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared&quot;        
## [10211] &quot;his patient materially better.  Her pulse was much stronger, and every&quot;      
## [10212] &quot;symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit.  Elinor, confirmed&quot;     
## [10213] &quot;in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her&quot;         
## [10214] &quot;letters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than her&quot;     
## [10215] &quot;friend&#39;s, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them&quot;      
## [10216] &quot;at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able&quot;     
## [10217] &quot;to travel.&quot;                                                                  
## [10218] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10219] &quot;But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.-- Towards the&quot;        
## [10220] &quot;evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and&quot;        
## [10221] &quot;uncomfortable than before.  Her sister, however, still sanguine, was&quot;        
## [10222] &quot;willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of&quot;         
## [10223] &quot;having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering the&quot;         
## [10224] &quot;cordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a&quot;        
## [10225] &quot;slumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects.  Her&quot;          
## [10226] &quot;sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a&quot;             
## [10227] &quot;considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself, she&quot;     
## [10228] &quot;resolved to sit with her during the whole of it.  Mrs. Jennings,&quot;            
## [10229] &quot;knowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to&quot;       
## [10230] &quot;bed; her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating&quot;          
## [10231] &quot;herself in the housekeeper&#39;s room, and Elinor remained alone with&quot;           
## [10232] &quot;Marianne.&quot;                                                                   
## [10233] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10234] &quot;The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her&quot;            
## [10235] &quot;sister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change of&quot;     
## [10236] &quot;posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint&quot;        
## [10237] &quot;which passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful&quot;      
## [10238] &quot;a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in&quot;     
## [10239] &quot;the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness, cried out,--&quot;    
## [10240] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10241] &quot;\&quot;Is mama coming?--\&quot;&quot;                                                       
## [10242] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10243] &quot;\&quot;Not yet,\&quot; cried the other, concealing her terror, and assisting&quot;          
## [10244] &quot;Marianne to lie down again, \&quot;but she will be here, I hope, before it is&quot;    
## [10245] &quot;long.  It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton.\&quot;&quot;                 
## [10246] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10247] &quot;\&quot;But she must not go round by London,\&quot; cried Marianne, in the same&quot;        
## [10248] &quot;hurried manner.  \&quot;I shall never see her, if she goes by London.\&quot;&quot;          
## [10249] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10250] &quot;Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, while&quot;      
## [10251] &quot;attempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse.  It was lower and&quot;         
## [10252] &quot;quicker than ever!  and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her&quot;         
## [10253] &quot;alarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantly&quot;        
## [10254] &quot;for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother.&quot;       
## [10255] &quot;To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the&quot;          
## [10256] &quot;latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its&quot;      
## [10257] &quot;performance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by&quot;      
## [10258] &quot;her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew he&quot;        
## [10259] &quot;was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.&quot;            
## [10260] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10261] &quot;It was no time for hesitation.  Her fears and her difficulties were&quot;         
## [10262] &quot;immediately before him.  Her fears, he had no courage, no confidence to&quot;     
## [10263] &quot;attempt the removal of:--he listened to them in silent despondence;--but&quot;    
## [10264] &quot;her difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that&quot;         
## [10265] &quot;seemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his mind,&quot;     
## [10266] &quot;he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.&quot;         
## [10267] &quot;Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She thanked him&quot;     
## [10268] &quot;with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to hurry off his&quot;    
## [10269] &quot;servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for post-horses&quot;          
## [10270] &quot;directly, she wrote a few lines to her mother.&quot;                              
## [10271] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10272] &quot;The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon--or such&quot;     
## [10273] &quot;a companion for her mother,--how gratefully was it felt!--a companion&quot;       
## [10274] &quot;whose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve, and whose&quot;        
## [10275] &quot;friendship might soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summons&quot;         
## [10276] &quot;COULD be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,&quot;        
## [10277] &quot;would lessen it.&quot;                                                            
## [10278] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10279] &quot;HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness of a&quot;     
## [10280] &quot;collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost&quot;            
## [10281] &quot;despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might&quot;         
## [10282] &quot;look for his return.  Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.  The&quot;      
## [10283] &quot;horses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon&quot;         
## [10284] &quot;only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words spoken&quot;     
## [10285] &quot;too low to reach her ear, hurried into the carriage.  It was then about&quot;     
## [10286] &quot;twelve o&#39;clock, and she returned to her sister&#39;s apartment to wait for&quot;      
## [10287] &quot;the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the rest of the&quot;          
## [10288] &quot;night.  It was a night of almost equal suffering to both.  Hour after&quot;       
## [10289] &quot;hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne&#39;s side, and&quot;     
## [10290] &quot;in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor&#39;s, before Mr. Harris appeared.  Her&quot;     
## [10291] &quot;apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all her former&quot;          
## [10292] &quot;security; and the servant who sat up with her, for she would not allow&quot;      
## [10293] &quot;Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her more, by hints of what&quot;        
## [10294] &quot;her mistress had always thought.&quot;                                            
## [10295] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10296] &quot;Marianne&#39;s ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her&quot;        
## [10297] &quot;mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the&quot;          
## [10298] &quot;heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with&quot;      
## [10299] &quot;so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,&quot;            
## [10300] &quot;fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had&quot;         
## [10301] &quot;been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother&quot;         
## [10302] &quot;arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.&quot;        
## [10303] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10304] &quot;She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if HE could&quot;        
## [10305] &quot;not come, for some other advice, when the former--but not till after&quot;        
## [10306] &quot;five o&#39;clock--arrived.  His opinion, however, made some little amends&quot;       
## [10307] &quot;for his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and&quot;               
## [10308] &quot;unpleasant alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to&quot;      
## [10309] &quot;be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment&quot;       
## [10310] &quot;must procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was&quot;              
## [10311] &quot;communicated to Elinor.  He promised to call again in the course of&quot;         
## [10312] &quot;three or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious&quot;              
## [10313] &quot;attendant more composed than he had found them.&quot;                             
## [10314] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10315] &quot;With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to&quot;       
## [10316] &quot;their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.&quot;        
## [10317] &quot;Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her no&quot;     
## [10318] &quot;doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, her&quot;       
## [10319] &quot;conviction of her sister&#39;s danger would not allow her to offer the&quot;          
## [10320] &quot;comfort of hope.  Her heart was really grieved.  The rapid decay, the&quot;       
## [10321] &quot;early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have struck&quot;     
## [10322] &quot;a less interested person with concern.  On Mrs. Jennings&#39;s compassion&quot;       
## [10323] &quot;she had other claims.  She had been for three months her companion, was&quot;     
## [10324] &quot;still under her care, and she was known to have been greatly injured,&quot;       
## [10325] &quot;and long unhappy.  The distress of her sister too, particularly a&quot;           
## [10326] &quot;favourite, was before her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings&quot;     
## [10327] &quot;considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to&quot;     
## [10328] &quot;herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere.&quot;                   
## [10329] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10330] &quot;Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;--but he came to be&quot;             
## [10331] &quot;disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce.  His&quot;              
## [10332] &quot;medicines had failed;--the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more&quot;       
## [10333] &quot;quiet--not more herself--remained in a heavy stupor.  Elinor, catching&quot;      
## [10334] &quot;all, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in&quot;          
## [10335] &quot;further advice.  But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something&quot;       
## [10336] &quot;more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as&quot;        
## [10337] &quot;confident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging&quot;             
## [10338] &quot;assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss&quot;     
## [10339] &quot;Dashwood.  She was calm, except when she thought of her mother; but she&quot;     
## [10340] &quot;was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till noon,&quot;             
## [10341] &quot;scarcely stirring from her sister&#39;s bed, her thoughts wandering from&quot;        
## [10342] &quot;one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her spirits&quot;        
## [10343] &quot;oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, who&quot;           
## [10344] &quot;scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the&quot;     
## [10345] &quot;many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne&#39;s disappointment&quot;        
## [10346] &quot;had brought on.  Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it&quot;     
## [10347] &quot;gave fresh misery to her reflections.&quot;                                       
## [10348] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10349] &quot;About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a dread of&quot;              
## [10350] &quot;disappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her&quot;             
## [10351] &quot;friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her&quot;      
## [10352] &quot;sister&#39;s pulse;--she waited, watched, and examined it again and&quot;             
## [10353] &quot;again;--and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under&quot;         
## [10354] &quot;exterior calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to&quot;             
## [10355] &quot;communicate her hopes.  Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,&quot;       
## [10356] &quot;to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from&quot;     
## [10357] &quot;indulging a thought of its continuance;--and Elinor, conning over every&quot;     
## [10358] &quot;injunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope.  But it was&quot;      
## [10359] &quot;too late.  Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious&quot;            
## [10360] &quot;flutter, she bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what.&quot;       
## [10361] &quot;Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her.&quot;       
## [10362] &quot;Others even arose to confirm it.  Her breath, her skin, her lips, all&quot;       
## [10363] &quot;flattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes&quot;       
## [10364] &quot;on her with a rational, though languid, gaze.  Anxiety and hope now&quot;         
## [10365] &quot;oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity&quot;      
## [10366] &quot;till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o&#39;clock;--when his assurances,&quot;       
## [10367] &quot;his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his&quot;           
## [10368] &quot;expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.&quot;                
## [10369] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10370] &quot;Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her&quot;        
## [10371] &quot;entirely out of danger.  Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the&quot;          
## [10372] &quot;partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their&quot;      
## [10373] &quot;late alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,&quot;         
## [10374] &quot;with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the&quot;             
## [10375] &quot;probability of an entire recovery.&quot;                                          
## [10376] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10377] &quot;Elinor could not be cheerful.  Her joy was of a different kind, and led&quot;     
## [10378] &quot;to any thing rather than to gaiety.  Marianne restored to life, health,&quot;     
## [10379] &quot;friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with&quot;       
## [10380] &quot;sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent&quot;                   
## [10381] &quot;gratitude;--but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,&quot;       
## [10382] &quot;no smiles.  All within Elinor&#39;s breast was satisfaction, silent and&quot;         
## [10383] &quot;strong.&quot;                                                                     
## [10384] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10385] &quot;She continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the&quot;       
## [10386] &quot;whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her&quot;        
## [10387] &quot;enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every&quot;       
## [10388] &quot;look and every breath.  The possibility of a relapse would of course,&quot;       
## [10389] &quot;in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was--but when she&quot;      
## [10390] &quot;saw, on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of&quot;          
## [10391] &quot;recovery continued, and saw Marianne at six o&#39;clock sink into a quiet,&quot;      
## [10392] &quot;steady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every&quot;        
## [10393] &quot;doubt.&quot;                                                                      
## [10394] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10395] &quot;The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected&quot;         
## [10396] &quot;back.  At ten o&#39;clock, she trusted, or at least not much later her&quot;          
## [10397] &quot;mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must&quot;       
## [10398] &quot;now be travelling towards them.  The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely&quot;        
## [10399] &quot;less an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress of time which&quot;       
## [10400] &quot;yet kept them in ignorance!&quot;                                                 
## [10401] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10402] &quot;At seven o&#39;clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined&quot;         
## [10403] &quot;Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea.  Of breakfast she had been&quot;        
## [10404] &quot;kept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating&quot;       
## [10405] &quot;much;--and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of&quot;        
## [10406] &quot;content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome.  Mrs. Jennings&quot;      
## [10407] &quot;would have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before&quot;       
## [10408] &quot;her mother&#39;s arrival, and allow HER to take her place by Marianne; but&quot;      
## [10409] &quot;Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that moment&quot;       
## [10410] &quot;about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an&quot;               
## [10411] &quot;unnecessary instant.  Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs&quot;       
## [10412] &quot;into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,&quot;         
## [10413] &quot;left her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to her&quot;     
## [10414] &quot;own room to write letters and sleep.&quot;                                        
## [10415] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10416] &quot;The night was cold and stormy.  The wind roared round the house, and&quot;        
## [10417] &quot;the rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,&quot;        
## [10418] &quot;regarded it not.  Marianne slept through every blast; and the&quot;               
## [10419] &quot;travellers--they had a rich reward in store, for every present&quot;              
## [10420] &quot;inconvenience.&quot;                                                              
## [10421] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10422] &quot;The clock struck eight.  Had it been ten, Elinor would have been&quot;            
## [10423] &quot;convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the&quot;        
## [10424] &quot;house; and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite of the&quot;       
## [10425] &quot;ALMOST impossibility of their being already come, that she moved into&quot;       
## [10426] &quot;the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be&quot;            
## [10427] &quot;satisfied of the truth.  She instantly saw that her ears had not&quot;            
## [10428] &quot;deceived her.  The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in&quot;          
## [10429] &quot;view.  By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be&quot;      
## [10430] &quot;drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor&quot;        
## [10431] &quot;mother&#39;s alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.&quot;          
## [10432] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10433] &quot;Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at&quot;        
## [10434] &quot;that moment.  The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the&quot;       
## [10435] &quot;carriage stopt at the door--of her doubt--her dread--perhaps her&quot;            
## [10436] &quot;despair!--and of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was&quot;          
## [10437] &quot;impossible to be calm.  All that remained to be done was to be speedy;&quot;      
## [10438] &quot;and, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings&#39;s maid&quot;       
## [10439] &quot;with her sister, she hurried down stairs.&quot;                                   
## [10440] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10441] &quot;The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby,&quot;            
## [10442] &quot;assured her that they were already in the house.  She rushed to the&quot;         
## [10443] &quot;drawing-room,--she entered it,--and saw only Willoughby.&quot;                    
## [10444] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10445] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10446] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10447] &quot;CHAPTER 44&quot;                                                                  
## [10448] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10449] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10450] &quot;Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him, obeyed&quot;     
## [10451] &quot;the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room,&quot;       
## [10452] &quot;and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was suspended by&quot;      
## [10453] &quot;his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of command than&quot;        
## [10454] &quot;supplication,&quot;                                                               
## [10455] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10456] &quot;\&quot;Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--I entreat you to&quot;        
## [10457] &quot;stay.\&quot;&quot;                                                                     
## [10458] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10459] &quot;\&quot;No, sir,\&quot; she replied with firmness, \&quot;I shall NOT stay.  Your business&quot;  
## [10460] &quot;cannot be with ME.  The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell you that&quot;        
## [10461] &quot;Mr. Palmer was not in the house.\&quot;&quot;                                          
## [10462] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10463] &quot;\&quot;Had they told me,\&quot; he cried with vehemence, \&quot;that Mr. Palmer and all&quot;    
## [10464] &quot;his relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from the&quot;       
## [10465] &quot;door.  My business is with you, and only you.\&quot;&quot;                             
## [10466] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10467] &quot;\&quot;With me!\&quot;--in the utmost amazement--\&quot;well, sir,--be quick--and if you&quot;   
## [10468] &quot;can--less violent.\&quot;&quot;                                                        
## [10469] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10470] &quot;\&quot;Sit down, and I will be both.\&quot;&quot;                                           
## [10471] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10472] &quot;She hesitated; she knew not what to do.  The possibility of Colonel&quot;         
## [10473] &quot;Brandon&#39;s arriving and finding her there, came across her.  But she had&quot;     
## [10474] &quot;promised to hear him, and her curiosity no less than her honor was&quot;          
## [10475] &quot;engaged.  After a moment&#39;s recollection, therefore, concluding that&quot;         
## [10476] &quot;prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would best&quot;            
## [10477] &quot;promote it, she walked silently towards the table, and sat down.  He&quot;        
## [10478] &quot;took the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by&quot;       
## [10479] &quot;either.&quot;                                                                     
## [10480] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10481] &quot;\&quot;Pray be quick, sir,\&quot;--said Elinor, impatiently;--\&quot;I have no time to&quot;     
## [10482] &quot;spare.\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
## [10483] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10484] &quot;He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to&quot;         
## [10485] &quot;hear her.&quot;                                                                   
## [10486] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10487] &quot;\&quot;Your sister,\&quot; said he, with abruptness, a moment afterwards--\&quot;is out&quot;    
## [10488] &quot;of danger.  I heard it from the servant.  God be praised!--But is it&quot;        
## [10489] &quot;true? is it really true?\&quot;&quot;                                                  
## [10490] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10491] &quot;Elinor would not speak.  He repeated the inquiry with yet greater&quot;           
## [10492] &quot;eagerness.&quot;                                                                  
## [10493] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10494] &quot;\&quot;For God&#39;s sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?\&quot;&quot;            
## [10495] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10496] &quot;\&quot;We hope she is.\&quot;&quot;                                                         
## [10497] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10498] &quot;He rose up, and walked across the room.&quot;                                     
## [10499] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10500] &quot;\&quot;Had I known as much half an hour ago--But since I AM here,\&quot;--speaking&quot;    
## [10501] &quot;with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat--\&quot;what does it&quot;           
## [10502] &quot;signify?--For once, Miss Dashwood--it will be the last time,&quot;                
## [10503] &quot;perhaps--let us be cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for&quot;              
## [10504] &quot;gaiety.-- Tell me honestly\&quot;--a deeper glow overspreading his&quot;               
## [10505] &quot;cheeks--\&quot;do you think me most a knave or a fool?\&quot;&quot;                         
## [10506] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10507] &quot;Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever.  She began to&quot;     
## [10508] &quot;think that he must be in liquor;--the strangeness of such a visit, and&quot;      
## [10509] &quot;of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this&quot;            
## [10510] &quot;impression she immediately rose, saying,&quot;                                    
## [10511] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10512] &quot;\&quot;Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe--I am not&quot;      
## [10513] &quot;at leisure to remain with you longer.-- Whatever your business may be&quot;       
## [10514] &quot;with me, it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow.\&quot;&quot;           
## [10515] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10516] &quot;\&quot;I understand you,\&quot; he replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice&quot;     
## [10517] &quot;perfectly calm; \&quot;yes, I am very drunk.-- A pint of porter with my cold&quot;     
## [10518] &quot;beef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me.\&quot;&quot;                            
## [10519] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10520] &quot;\&quot;At Marlborough!\&quot;--cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand&quot;    
## [10521] &quot;what he would be at.&quot;                                                        
## [10522] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10523] &quot;\&quot;Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o&#39;clock, and the only ten&quot;       
## [10524] &quot;minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a&quot;         
## [10525] &quot;nuncheon at Marlborough.\&quot;&quot;                                                  
## [10526] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10527] &quot;The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence of his eye as he&quot;         
## [10528] &quot;spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might&quot;      
## [10529] &quot;bring him to Cleveland, he was not brought there by intoxication, she&quot;       
## [10530] &quot;said, after a moment&#39;s recollection,&quot;                                        
## [10531] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10532] &quot;\&quot;Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly DO--that after what&quot;    
## [10533] &quot;has passed--your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself upon&quot;      
## [10534] &quot;my notice, requires a very particular excuse.--What is it, that you&quot;         
## [10535] &quot;mean by it?\&quot;--&quot;                                                             
## [10536] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10537] &quot;\&quot;I mean,\&quot;--said he, with serious energy--\&quot;if I can, to make you hate me&quot;  
## [10538] &quot;one degree less than you do NOW.  I mean to offer some kind of&quot;              
## [10539] &quot;explanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart&quot;     
## [10540] &quot;to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a&quot;             
## [10541] &quot;blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like&quot;        
## [10542] &quot;forgiveness from Ma--from your sister.\&quot;&quot;                                    
## [10543] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10544] &quot;\&quot;Is this the real reason of your coming?\&quot;&quot;                                 
## [10545] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10546] &quot;\&quot;Upon my soul it is,\&quot;--was his answer, with a warmth which brought all&quot;    
## [10547] &quot;the former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of herself made&quot;      
## [10548] &quot;her think him sincere.&quot;                                                      
## [10549] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10550] &quot;\&quot;If that is all, you may be satisfied already,--for Marianne DOES--she&quot;     
## [10551] &quot;has LONG forgiven you.\&quot;&quot;                                                    
## [10552] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10553] &quot;\&quot;Has she?\&quot;--he cried, in the same eager tone.-- \&quot;Then she has forgiven&quot;   
## [10554] &quot;me before she ought to have done it.  But she shall forgive me again,&quot;       
## [10555] &quot;and on more reasonable grounds.--NOW will you listen to me?\&quot;&quot;               
## [10556] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10557] &quot;Elinor bowed her assent.&quot;                                                    
## [10558] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10559] &quot;\&quot;I do not know,\&quot; said he, after a pause of expectation on her side, and&quot;   
## [10560] &quot;thoughtfulness on his own,--\&quot;how YOU may have accounted for my&quot;             
## [10561] &quot;behaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have&quot;            
## [10562] &quot;imputed to me.-- Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is&quot;     
## [10563] &quot;worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing.  When I first&quot;      
## [10564] &quot;became intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other view&quot;     
## [10565] &quot;in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged&quot;     
## [10566] &quot;to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.&quot;       
## [10567] &quot;Your sister&#39;s lovely person and interesting manners could not but&quot;           
## [10568] &quot;please me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a&quot;          
## [10569] &quot;kind--It is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what SHE&quot;        
## [10570] &quot;was, that my heart should have been so insensible!  But at first I must&quot;     
## [10571] &quot;confess, my vanity only was elevated by it.  Careless of her happiness,&quot;     
## [10572] &quot;thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had&quot;       
## [10573] &quot;always been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every&quot;     
## [10574] &quot;means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any design&quot;       
## [10575] &quot;of returning her affection.\&quot;&quot;                                               
## [10576] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10577] &quot;Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him with the most&quot;         
## [10578] &quot;angry contempt, stopped him, by saying,&quot;                                     
## [10579] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10580] &quot;\&quot;It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for me&quot;    
## [10581] &quot;to listen any longer.  Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by&quot;       
## [10582] &quot;any thing.-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the&quot;       
## [10583] &quot;subject.\&quot;&quot;                                                                  
## [10584] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10585] &quot;\&quot;I insist on you hearing the whole of it,\&quot; he replied, \&quot;My fortune was&quot;   
## [10586] &quot;never large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of&quot;        
## [10587] &quot;associating with people of better income than myself.  Every year since&quot;     
## [10588] &quot;my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and&quot;     
## [10589] &quot;though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yet&quot;      
## [10590] &quot;that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for&quot;       
## [10591] &quot;some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a&quot;       
## [10592] &quot;woman of fortune.  To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was not&quot;      
## [10593] &quot;a thing to be thought of;--and with a meanness, selfishness,&quot;                
## [10594] &quot;cruelty--which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, Miss&quot;      
## [10595] &quot;Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I was acting in this manner,&quot;         
## [10596] &quot;trying to engage her regard, without a thought of returning it.--But&quot;        
## [10597] &quot;one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish&quot;          
## [10598] &quot;vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated, because I&quot;      
## [10599] &quot;did not THEN know what it was to love.  But have I ever known it?--Well&quot;     
## [10600] &quot;may it be doubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my&quot;      
## [10601] &quot;feelings to vanity, to avarice?--or, what is more, could I have&quot;             
## [10602] &quot;sacrificed hers?-- But I have done it.  To avoid a comparative poverty,&quot;     
## [10603] &quot;which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its&quot;          
## [10604] &quot;horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence, lost every thing that&quot;      
## [10605] &quot;could make it a blessing.\&quot;&quot;                                                 
## [10606] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10607] &quot;\&quot;You did then,\&quot; said Elinor, a little softened, \&quot;believe yourself at&quot;     
## [10608] &quot;one time attached to her?\&quot;&quot;                                                 
## [10609] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10610] &quot;\&quot;To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such&quot;                 
## [10611] &quot;tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have done it?--Yes, I&quot;        
## [10612] &quot;found myself, by insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the&quot;         
## [10613] &quot;happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my&quot;         
## [10614] &quot;intentions were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.  Even&quot;       
## [10615] &quot;THEN, however, when fully determined on paying my addresses to her, I&quot;       
## [10616] &quot;allowed myself most improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment&quot;      
## [10617] &quot;of doing it, from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my&quot;     
## [10618] &quot;circumstances were so greatly embarrassed.  I will not reason here--nor&quot;     
## [10619] &quot;will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse than&quot;       
## [10620] &quot;absurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already&quot;      
## [10621] &quot;bound.  The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing with&quot;     
## [10622] &quot;great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself&quot;            
## [10623] &quot;contemptible and wretched for ever.  At last, however, my resolution&quot;        
## [10624] &quot;was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone,&quot;       
## [10625] &quot;to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and openly&quot;          
## [10626] &quot;assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to&quot;          
## [10627] &quot;display.  But in the interim--in the interim of the very few hours that&quot;     
## [10628] &quot;were to pass, before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her&quot;       
## [10629] &quot;in private--a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin&quot;       
## [10630] &quot;all my resolution, and with it all my comfort.  A discovery took&quot;            
## [10631] &quot;place,\&quot;--here he hesitated and looked down.--\&quot;Mrs. Smith had somehow or&quot;   
## [10632] &quot;other been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest&quot;     
## [10633] &quot;it was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connection--but I&quot;       
## [10634] &quot;need not explain myself farther,\&quot; he added, looking at her with an&quot;         
## [10635] &quot;heightened colour and an enquiring eye--\&quot;your particular intimacy--you&quot;     
## [10636] &quot;have probably heard the whole story long ago.\&quot;&quot;                             
## [10637] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10638] &quot;\&quot;I have,\&quot; returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her heart&quot;    
## [10639] &quot;anew against any compassion for him, \&quot;I have heard it all.  And how you&quot;    
## [10640] &quot;will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I&quot;       
## [10641] &quot;confess is beyond my comprehension.\&quot;&quot;                                       
## [10642] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10643] &quot;\&quot;Remember,\&quot; cried Willoughby, \&quot;from whom you received the account.&quot;       
## [10644] &quot;Could it be an impartial one?  I acknowledge that her situation and her&quot;     
## [10645] &quot;character ought to have been respected by me.  I do not mean to justify&quot;     
## [10646] &quot;myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have&quot;        
## [10647] &quot;nothing to urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,&quot;       
## [10648] &quot;and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.  If the violence of&quot;     
## [10649] &quot;her passions, the weakness of her understanding--I do not mean,&quot;             
## [10650] &quot;however, to defend myself.  Her affection for me deserved better&quot;            
## [10651] &quot;treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness&quot;     
## [10652] &quot;which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return.  I&quot;      
## [10653] &quot;wish--I heartily wish it had never been.  But I have injured more than&quot;      
## [10654] &quot;herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for me--(may I say&quot;         
## [10655] &quot;it?) was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose mind--Oh! how&quot;              
## [10656] &quot;infinitely superior!\&quot;--&quot;                                                    
## [10657] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10658] &quot;\&quot;Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl--I must say&quot;     
## [10659] &quot;it, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well&quot;           
## [10660] &quot;be--your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her.  Do&quot;      
## [10661] &quot;not think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of&quot;           
## [10662] &quot;understanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.&quot;       
## [10663] &quot;You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in&quot;               
## [10664] &quot;Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she was&quot;        
## [10665] &quot;reduced to the extremest indigence.\&quot;&quot;                                       
## [10666] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10667] &quot;\&quot;But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it,\&quot; he warmly replied; \&quot;I did not&quot;    
## [10668] &quot;recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction; and common sense&quot;     
## [10669] &quot;might have told her how to find it out.\&quot;&quot;                                   
## [10670] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10671] &quot;\&quot;Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?\&quot;&quot;                                    
## [10672] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10673] &quot;\&quot;She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be&quot;            
## [10674] &quot;guessed.  The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her&quot;         
## [10675] &quot;ignorance of the world--every thing was against me.  The matter itself&quot;      
## [10676] &quot;I could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it.  She was&quot;       
## [10677] &quot;previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in&quot;      
## [10678] &quot;general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,&quot;      
## [10679] &quot;the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my&quot;        
## [10680] &quot;present visit.  In short, it ended in a total breach.  By one measure I&quot;     
## [10681] &quot;might have saved myself.  In the height of her morality, good woman!&quot;        
## [10682] &quot;she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza.  That could&quot;        
## [10683] &quot;not be--and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house.&quot;         
## [10684] &quot;The night following this affair--I was to go the next morning--was&quot;          
## [10685] &quot;spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be.  The&quot;       
## [10686] &quot;struggle was great--but it ended too soon.  My affection for Marianne,&quot;      
## [10687] &quot;my thorough conviction of her attachment to me--it was all insufficient&quot;     
## [10688] &quot;to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false&quot;         
## [10689] &quot;ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to&quot;         
## [10690] &quot;feel, and expensive society had increased.  I had reason to believe&quot;         
## [10691] &quot;myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her, and I&quot;          
## [10692] &quot;persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained&quot;     
## [10693] &quot;for me to do.  A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave&quot;       
## [10694] &quot;Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day; some&quot;          
## [10695] &quot;apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement.  But&quot;       
## [10696] &quot;whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in person, was a&quot;         
## [10697] &quot;point of long debate.  To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and&quot;      
## [10698] &quot;I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep to my&quot;                
## [10699] &quot;resolution.  In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,&quot;      
## [10700] &quot;as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw her miserable,&quot;        
## [10701] &quot;and left her miserable--and left her hoping never to see her again.\&quot;&quot;       
## [10702] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10703] &quot;\&quot;Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?\&quot; said Elinor, reproachfully; \&quot;a note&quot;  
## [10704] &quot;would have answered every purpose.-- Why was it necessary to call?\&quot;&quot;        
## [10705] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10706] &quot;\&quot;It was necessary to my own pride.  I could not bear to leave the&quot;          
## [10707] &quot;country in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of the&quot;                 
## [10708] &quot;neighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between&quot;        
## [10709] &quot;Mrs. Smith and myself--and I resolved therefore on calling at the&quot;           
## [10710] &quot;cottage, in my way to Honiton.  The sight of your dear sister, however,&quot;     
## [10711] &quot;was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter, I found her alone.&quot;        
## [10712] &quot;You were all gone I do not know where.  I had left her only the evening&quot;     
## [10713] &quot;before, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on doing right!  A&quot;      
## [10714] &quot;few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever; and I remember how&quot;       
## [10715] &quot;happy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage to&quot;             
## [10716] &quot;Allenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body!  But in&quot;         
## [10717] &quot;this, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with a sense&quot;       
## [10718] &quot;of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling.  Her&quot;            
## [10719] &quot;sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told her that I was&quot;     
## [10720] &quot;obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I never shall forget&quot;            
## [10721] &quot;it--united too with such reliance, such confidence in me!--Oh,&quot;              
## [10722] &quot;God!--what a hard-hearted rascal I was!\&quot;&quot;                                   
## [10723] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10724] &quot;They were both silent for a few moments.  Elinor first spoke.&quot;               
## [10725] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10726] &quot;\&quot;Did you tell her that you should soon return?\&quot;&quot;                           
## [10727] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10728] &quot;\&quot;I do not know what I told her,\&quot; he replied, impatiently; \&quot;less than&quot;     
## [10729] &quot;was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more&quot;        
## [10730] &quot;than was justified by the future.  I cannot think of it.--It won&#39;t&quot;          
## [10731] &quot;do.--Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her&quot;         
## [10732] &quot;kindness and confidence.  Thank Heaven! it DID torture me.  I was&quot;           
## [10733] &quot;miserable.  Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it&quot;        
## [10734] &quot;gives me to look back on my own misery.  I owe such a grudge to myself&quot;      
## [10735] &quot;for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my past&quot;            
## [10736] &quot;sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now.  Well, I&quot;     
## [10737] &quot;went, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was&quot;      
## [10738] &quot;only indifferent.  My journey to town--travelling with my own horses,&quot;       
## [10739] &quot;and therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my own reflections&quot;     
## [10740] &quot;so cheerful--when I looked forward every thing so inviting!--when I&quot;         
## [10741] &quot;looked back at Barton, the picture so soothing!--oh, it was a blessed&quot;       
## [10742] &quot;journey!\&quot;&quot;                                                                  
## [10743] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10744] &quot;He stopped.&quot;                                                                 
## [10745] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10746] &quot;\&quot;Well, sir,\&quot; said Elinor, who, though pitying him, grew impatient for&quot;     
## [10747] &quot;his departure, \&quot;and this is all?\&quot;&quot;                                         
## [10748] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10749] &quot;\&quot;Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?-- That infamous&quot;            
## [10750] &quot;letter--Did she shew it you?\&quot;&quot;                                              
## [10751] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10752] &quot;\&quot;Yes, I saw every note that passed.\&quot;&quot;                                      
## [10753] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10754] &quot;\&quot;When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did, for I was in&quot;    
## [10755] &quot;town the whole time,) what I felt is--in the common phrase, not to be&quot;       
## [10756] &quot;expressed; in a more simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any&quot;            
## [10757] &quot;emotion--my feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every word&quot;       
## [10758] &quot;was--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here,&quot;      
## [10759] &quot;would forbid--a dagger to my heart.  To know that Marianne was in town&quot;      
## [10760] &quot;was--in the same language--a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and&quot;                 
## [10761] &quot;daggers!--what a reproof would she have given me!--her taste, her&quot;           
## [10762] &quot;opinions--I believe they are better known to me than my own,--and I am&quot;      
## [10763] &quot;sure they are dearer.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
## [10764] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10765] &quot;Elinor&#39;s heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this&quot;      
## [10766] &quot;extraordinary conversation, was now softened again;--yet she felt it&quot;        
## [10767] &quot;her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last.&quot;                  
## [10768] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10769] &quot;\&quot;This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that you are married.&quot;        
## [10770] &quot;Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear.\&quot;&quot;   
## [10771] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10772] &quot;\&quot;Marianne&#39;s note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in&quot;     
## [10773] &quot;former days, that in spite of the many, many weeks we had been&quot;              
## [10774] &quot;separated, she was as constant in her own feelings, and as full of&quot;          
## [10775] &quot;faith in the constancy of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.  I say&quot;     
## [10776] &quot;awakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had in&quot;         
## [10777] &quot;some measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardened&quot;             
## [10778] &quot;villain, fancying myself indifferent to her, and chusing to fancy that&quot;      
## [10779] &quot;she too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of our&quot;        
## [10780] &quot;past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my&quot;          
## [10781] &quot;shoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,&quot;           
## [10782] &quot;overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, &#39;I shall be&quot;      
## [10783] &quot;heartily glad to hear she is well married.&#39;-- But this note made me&quot;         
## [10784] &quot;know myself better.  I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than&quot;       
## [10785] &quot;any other woman in the world, and that I was using her infamously.  But&quot;     
## [10786] &quot;every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me.  To retreat&quot;     
## [10787] &quot;was impossible.  All that I had to do, was to avoid you both.  I sent&quot;       
## [10788] &quot;no answer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from her&quot;        
## [10789] &quot;farther notice; and for some time I was even determined not to call in&quot;      
## [10790] &quot;Berkeley Street;--but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of a&quot;      
## [10791] &quot;cool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all safely&quot;      
## [10792] &quot;out of the house one morning, and left my name.\&quot;&quot;                           
## [10793] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10794] &quot;\&quot;Watched us out of the house!\&quot;&quot;                                            
## [10795] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10796] &quot;\&quot;Even so.  You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how&quot;     
## [10797] &quot;often I was on the point of falling in with you.  I have entered many a&quot;     
## [10798] &quot;shop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by.  Lodging as I did&quot;       
## [10799] &quot;in Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a&quot;           
## [10800] &quot;glimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant&quot;           
## [10801] &quot;watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep&quot;        
## [10802] &quot;out of your sight, could have separated us so long.  I avoided the&quot;          
## [10803] &quot;Middletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who was&quot;           
## [10804] &quot;likely to prove an acquaintance in common.  Not aware of their being in&quot;     
## [10805] &quot;town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of his&quot;     
## [10806] &quot;coming, and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings&#39;s.  He asked me&quot;     
## [10807] &quot;to a party, a dance at his house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as&quot;     
## [10808] &quot;an inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I should have&quot;      
## [10809] &quot;felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him.  The next&quot;            
## [10810] &quot;morning brought another short note from Marianne--still affectionate,&quot;       
## [10811] &quot;open, artless, confiding--everything that could make MY conduct most&quot;        
## [10812] &quot;hateful.  I could not answer it.  I tried--but could not frame a&quot;            
## [10813] &quot;sentence.  But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day.&quot;        
## [10814] &quot;If you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was THEN.&quot;        
## [10815] &quot;With my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play the&quot;        
## [10816] &quot;happy lover to another woman!--Those three or four weeks were worse&quot;         
## [10817] &quot;than all.  Well, at last, as I need not tell you, you were forced on&quot;        
## [10818] &quot;me; and what a sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!--&quot;      
## [10819] &quot;Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me Willoughby in&quot;       
## [10820] &quot;such a tone!--Oh, God!--holding out her hand to me, asking me for an&quot;        
## [10821] &quot;explanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking&quot;              
## [10822] &quot;solicitude on my face!--and Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other&quot;       
## [10823] &quot;hand, looking all that was--Well, it does not signify; it is over&quot;           
## [10824] &quot;now.-- Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could;&quot;        
## [10825] &quot;but not before I had seen Marianne&#39;s sweet face as white as&quot;                 
## [10826] &quot;death.--THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;--the last&quot;           
## [10827] &quot;manner in which she appeared to me.  It was a horrid sight!--yet when I&quot;     
## [10828] &quot;thought of her to-day as really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me&quot;       
## [10829] &quot;to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those, who saw&quot;       
## [10830] &quot;her last in this world.  She was before me, constantly before me, as I&quot;      
## [10831] &quot;travelled, in the same look and hue.\&quot;&quot;                                      
## [10832] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10833] &quot;A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded.  Willoughby first&quot;         
## [10834] &quot;rousing himself, broke it thus:&quot;                                             
## [10835] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10836] &quot;\&quot;Well, let me make haste and be gone.  Your sister is certainly better,&quot;    
## [10837] &quot;certainly out of danger?\&quot;&quot;                                                  
## [10838] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10839] &quot;\&quot;We are assured of it.\&quot;&quot;                                                   
## [10840] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10841] &quot;\&quot;Your poor mother, too!--doting on Marianne.\&quot;&quot;                             
## [10842] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10843] &quot;\&quot;But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; have you any thing to&quot;    
## [10844] &quot;say about that?\&quot;&quot;                                                           
## [10845] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10846] &quot;\&quot;Yes, yes, THAT in particular.  Your sister wrote to me again, you&quot;         
## [10847] &quot;know, the very next morning.  You saw what she said.  I was&quot;                 
## [10848] &quot;breakfasting at the Ellisons,--and her letter, with some others, was&quot;        
## [10849] &quot;brought to me there from my lodgings.  It happened to catch Sophia&#39;s&quot;        
## [10850] &quot;eye before it caught mine--and its size, the elegance of the paper, the&quot;     
## [10851] &quot;hand-writing altogether, immediately gave her a suspicion.  Some vague&quot;      
## [10852] &quot;report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in&quot;        
## [10853] &quot;Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation the preceding&quot;        
## [10854] &quot;evening had marked who the young lady was, and made her more jealous&quot;        
## [10855] &quot;than ever.  Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is&quot;          
## [10856] &quot;delightful in a woman one loves, she opened the letter directly,&quot;            
## [10857] &quot;and read its contents.  She was well paid for her impudence.&quot;                
## [10858] &quot;She read what made her wretched.  Her wretchedness I could have&quot;             
## [10859] &quot;borne, but her passion--her malice--At all events it must be appeased.&quot;      
## [10860] &quot;And, in short--what do you think of my wife&#39;s style of&quot;                      
## [10861] &quot;letter-writing?--delicate--tender--truly feminine--was it not?\&quot;&quot;            
## [10862] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10863] &quot;\&quot;Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand-writing.\&quot;&quot;                    
## [10864] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10865] &quot;\&quot;Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as&quot;     
## [10866] &quot;I was ashamed to put my name to.  The original was all her own--her own&quot;     
## [10867] &quot;happy thoughts and gentle diction.  But what could I do!--we were&quot;           
## [10868] &quot;engaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But I am&quot;         
## [10869] &quot;talking like a fool.  Preparation!--day!--In honest words, her money&quot;        
## [10870] &quot;was necessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be&quot;      
## [10871] &quot;done to prevent a rupture.  And after all, what did it signify to my&quot;        
## [10872] &quot;character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language&quot;      
## [10873] &quot;my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end.  My business&quot;     
## [10874] &quot;was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with a bow or a&quot;     
## [10875] &quot;bluster was of little importance.-- &#39;I am ruined for ever in their&quot;          
## [10876] &quot;opinion--&#39; said I to myself--&#39;I am shut out for ever from their&quot;             
## [10877] &quot;society, they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter will&quot;     
## [10878] &quot;only make them think me a blackguard one.&#39; Such were my reasonings, as,&quot;     
## [10879] &quot;in a sort of desperate carelessness, I copied my wife&#39;s words, and&quot;          
## [10880] &quot;parted with the last relics of Marianne.  Her three notes--unluckily&quot;        
## [10881] &quot;they were all in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their&quot;               
## [10882] &quot;existence, and hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put them up, and&quot;      
## [10883] &quot;could not even kiss them.  And the lock of hair--that too I had always&quot;      
## [10884] &quot;carried about me in the same pocket-book, which was now searched by&quot;         
## [10885] &quot;Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,--the dear lock--all, every&quot;      
## [10886] &quot;memento was torn from me.\&quot;&quot;                                                 
## [10887] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10888] &quot;\&quot;You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,\&quot; said Elinor, while&quot;   
## [10889] &quot;her voice, in spite of herself, betrayed her compassionate emotion;&quot;         
## [10890] &quot;\&quot;you ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my&quot;       
## [10891] &quot;sister.  You had made your own choice.  It was not forced on you.  Your&quot;     
## [10892] &quot;wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect, at least.  She&quot;        
## [10893] &quot;must be attached to you, or she would not have married you.  To treat&quot;       
## [10894] &quot;her with unkindness, to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to&quot;         
## [10895] &quot;Marianne--nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience.\&quot;&quot;           
## [10896] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10897] &quot;\&quot;Do not talk to me of my wife,\&quot; said he with a heavy sigh.-- \&quot;She does&quot;   
## [10898] &quot;not deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no regard for her when we&quot;      
## [10899] &quot;married.--Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be&quot;         
## [10900] &quot;happy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity&quot;      
## [10901] &quot;me, Miss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?-- Am I--be&quot;       
## [10902] &quot;it only one degree--am I less guilty in your opinion than I was&quot;             
## [10903] &quot;before?--My intentions were not always wrong.  Have I explained away&quot;        
## [10904] &quot;any part of my guilt?\&quot;&quot;                                                     
## [10905] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10906] &quot;\&quot;Yes, you have certainly removed something--a little.-- You have proved&quot;    
## [10907] &quot;yourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had believed you.  You have&quot;      
## [10908] &quot;proved your heart less wicked, much less wicked.  But I hardly&quot;              
## [10909] &quot;know--the misery that you have inflicted--I hardly know what could have&quot;     
## [10910] &quot;made it worse.\&quot;&quot;                                                            
## [10911] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10912] &quot;\&quot;Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered, what I have been&quot;    
## [10913] &quot;telling you?--Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well&quot;       
## [10914] &quot;as in yours.  You tell me that she has forgiven me already.  Let me be&quot;      
## [10915] &quot;able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present&quot;        
## [10916] &quot;feelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more&quot;         
## [10917] &quot;gentle, less dignified, forgiveness.  Tell her of my misery and my&quot;          
## [10918] &quot;penitence--tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if&quot;       
## [10919] &quot;you will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever.\&quot;&quot;              
## [10920] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10921] &quot;\&quot;I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be&quot;        
## [10922] &quot;called, your justification.  But you have not explained to me the&quot;           
## [10923] &quot;particular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her illness.\&quot;&quot;   
## [10924] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10925] &quot;\&quot;Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton, and&quot;    
## [10926] &quot;when he saw who I was--for the first time these two months--he spoke to&quot;     
## [10927] &quot;me.--That he had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen without&quot;          
## [10928] &quot;surprise or resentment.  Now, however, his good-natured, honest, stupid&quot;     
## [10929] &quot;soul, full of indignation against me, and concern for your sister,&quot;          
## [10930] &quot;could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought&quot;            
## [10931] &quot;to--though probably he did not think it WOULD--vex me horridly.  As&quot;         
## [10932] &quot;bluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne&quot;           
## [10933] &quot;Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a letter that&quot;            
## [10934] &quot;morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most&quot;                
## [10935] &quot;imminent--the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &amp;c.--I was too much&quot;     
## [10936] &quot;shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the&quot;             
## [10937] &quot;undiscerning Sir John.  His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer;&quot;       
## [10938] &quot;and so much of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted, he&quot;          
## [10939] &quot;almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise&quot;          
## [10940] &quot;about a pointer puppy.  What I felt on hearing that your sister was&quot;         
## [10941] &quot;dying--and dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth,&quot;         
## [10942] &quot;scorning, hating me in her latest moments--for how could I tell what&quot;        
## [10943] &quot;horrid projects might not have been imputed?  ONE person I was sure&quot;         
## [10944] &quot;would represent me as capable of any thing-- What I felt was&quot;                
## [10945] &quot;dreadful!--My resolution was soon made, and at eight o&#39;clock this&quot;           
## [10946] &quot;morning I was in my carriage.  Now you know all.\&quot;&quot;                          
## [10947] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10948] &quot;Elinor made no answer.  Her thoughts were silently fixed on the&quot;             
## [10949] &quot;irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent&quot;       
## [10950] &quot;habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the&quot;      
## [10951] &quot;character, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person&quot;        
## [10952] &quot;and talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a&quot;          
## [10953] &quot;feeling, affectionate temper.  The world had made him extravagant and&quot;       
## [10954] &quot;vain--Extravagance and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish.&quot;        
## [10955] &quot;Vanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another,&quot;     
## [10956] &quot;had involved him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least&quot;      
## [10957] &quot;its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed.  Each faulty&quot;       
## [10958] &quot;propensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to punishment.&quot;      
## [10959] &quot;The attachment, from which against honour, against feeling, against&quot;         
## [10960] &quot;every better interest he had outwardly torn himself, now, when no&quot;           
## [10961] &quot;longer allowable, governed every thought; and the connection, for the&quot;       
## [10962] &quot;sake of which he had, with little scruple, left her sister to misery,&quot;       
## [10963] &quot;was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more&quot;        
## [10964] &quot;incurable nature.  From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the&quot;      
## [10965] &quot;end of some minutes by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie&quot;      
## [10966] &quot;at least equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and&quot;          
## [10967] &quot;said--&quot;                                                                      
## [10968] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10969] &quot;\&quot;There is no use in staying here; I must be off.\&quot;&quot;                         
## [10970] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10971] &quot;\&quot;Are you going back to town?\&quot;&quot;                                             
## [10972] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10973] &quot;\&quot;No--to Combe Magna.  I have business there; from thence to town in a&quot;      
## [10974] &quot;day or two.  Good bye.\&quot;&quot;                                                    
## [10975] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10976] &quot;He held out his hand.  She could not refuse to give him hers;--he&quot;           
## [10977] &quot;pressed it with affection.&quot;                                                  
## [10978] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10979] &quot;\&quot;And you DO think something better of me than you did?\&quot;--said he,&quot;         
## [10980] &quot;letting it fall, and leaning against the mantel-piece as if forgetting&quot;      
## [10981] &quot;he was to go.&quot;                                                               
## [10982] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10983] &quot;Elinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave, pitied, wished him&quot;      
## [10984] &quot;well--was even interested in his happiness--and added some gentle&quot;           
## [10985] &quot;counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it.  His answer was&quot;      
## [10986] &quot;not very encouraging.&quot;                                                       
## [10987] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10988] &quot;\&quot;As to that,\&quot; said he, \&quot;I must rub through the world as well as I can.&quot;   
## [10989] &quot;Domestic happiness is out of the question.  If, however, I am allowed&quot;       
## [10990] &quot;to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions, it&quot;     
## [10991] &quot;may be the means--it may put me on my guard--at least, it may be&quot;            
## [10992] &quot;something to live for.  Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.&quot;         
## [10993] &quot;Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again--\&quot;&quot;                      
## [10994] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10995] &quot;Elinor stopped him with a reproof.&quot;                                          
## [10996] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [10997] &quot;\&quot;Well,\&quot;--he replied--\&quot;once more good bye. I shall now go away and live&quot;   
## [10998] &quot;in dread of one event.\&quot;&quot;                                                    
## [10999] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11000] &quot;\&quot;What do you mean?\&quot;&quot;                                                       
## [11001] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11002] &quot;\&quot;Your sister&#39;s marriage.\&quot;&quot;

## [11004] &quot;\&quot;You are very wrong.  She can never be more lost to you than she is&quot;        
## [11005] &quot;now.\&quot;&quot;                                                                      
## [11006] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11007] &quot;\&quot;But she will be gained by some one else.  And if that some one should&quot;     
## [11008] &quot;be the very he whom, of all others, I could least bear--but I will not&quot;      
## [11009] &quot;stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing that&quot;      
## [11010] &quot;where I have most injured I can least forgive.  Good bye,--God bless&quot;        
## [11011] &quot;you!\&quot;&quot;

## [11013] &quot;And with these words, he almost ran out of the room.&quot;                        
## [11014] &quot;&quot;

## [11017] &quot;CHAPTER 45&quot;                                                                  
## [11018] &quot;&quot;

## [11020] &quot;Elinor, for some time after he left her, for some time even after the&quot;       
## [11021] &quot;sound of his carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a&quot;       
## [11022] &quot;crowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness&quot;        
## [11023] &quot;was the general result, to think even of her sister.&quot;                        
## [11024] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11025] &quot;Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most&quot;     
## [11026] &quot;worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited a&quot;         
## [11027] &quot;degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which made&quot;     
## [11028] &quot;her think of him as now separated for ever from her family, with a&quot;          
## [11029] &quot;tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledged&quot;        
## [11030] &quot;within herself--to his wishes than to his merits.  She felt that his&quot;        
## [11031] &quot;influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not&quot;     
## [11032] &quot;in reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction, that&quot;       
## [11033] &quot;open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to possess;&quot;     
## [11034] &quot;and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not even&quot;           
## [11035] &quot;innocent to indulge.  But she felt that it was so, long, long before&quot;        
## [11036] &quot;she could feel his influence less.&quot;                                          
## [11037] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11038] &quot;When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne, she found her&quot;        
## [11039] &quot;just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of&quot;       
## [11040] &quot;her hopes.  Elinor&#39;s heart was full.  The past, the present, the&quot;            
## [11041] &quot;future, Willoughby&#39;s visit, Marianne&#39;s safety, and her mother&#39;s&quot;             
## [11042] &quot;expected arrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits&quot;         
## [11043] &quot;which kept off every indication of fatigue, and made her only fearful&quot;       
## [11044] &quot;of betraying herself to her sister.  Short was the time, however, in&quot;        
## [11045] &quot;which that fear could affect her, for within half an hour after&quot;             
## [11046] &quot;Willoughby&#39;s leaving the house, she was again called down stairs by the&quot;     
## [11047] &quot;sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her mother from every&quot;             
## [11048] &quot;unnecessary moment&#39;s horrible suspense, she ran immediately into the&quot;        
## [11049] &quot;hall, and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support&quot;      
## [11050] &quot;her as she entered it.&quot;                                                      
## [11051] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11052] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced&quot;        
## [11053] &quot;almost the conviction of Marianne&#39;s being no more, had no voice to&quot;          
## [11054] &quot;inquire after her, no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neither&quot;       
## [11055] &quot;for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--and her&quot;      
## [11056] &quot;mother, catching it with all her usual warmth, was in a moment as much&quot;      
## [11057] &quot;overcome by her happiness, as she had been before by her fears.  She&quot;        
## [11058] &quot;was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter and her&quot;            
## [11059] &quot;friend;--and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable to&quot;           
## [11060] &quot;speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at intervals&quot;       
## [11061] &quot;to press Colonel Brandon&#39;s hand, with a look which spoke at once her&quot;        
## [11062] &quot;gratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss&quot;      
## [11063] &quot;of the moment.  He shared it, however, in a silence even greater than&quot;       
## [11064] &quot;her own.&quot;                                                                    
## [11065] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11066] &quot;As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was her&quot;     
## [11067] &quot;first desire; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child,&quot;            
## [11068] &quot;rendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger.&quot;       
## [11069] &quot;Elinor&#39;s delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only&quot;        
## [11070] &quot;checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther&quot;               
## [11071] &quot;sleep;--but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when&quot;        
## [11072] &quot;the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing&quot;        
## [11073] &quot;her mother was near her, and conscious of being too weak for&quot;                
## [11074] &quot;conversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by&quot;      
## [11075] &quot;every nurse around her.  Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night;&quot;     
## [11076] &quot;and Elinor, in compliance with her mother&#39;s entreaty, went to bed.  But&quot;     
## [11077] &quot;the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the&quot;         
## [11078] &quot;most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by&quot;              
## [11079] &quot;irritation of spirits.  Willoughby, \&quot;poor Willoughby,\&quot; as she now&quot;         
## [11080] &quot;allowed herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she would&quot;      
## [11081] &quot;not but have heard his vindication for the world, and now blamed, now&quot;       
## [11082] &quot;acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before.  But her&quot;         
## [11083] &quot;promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful.  She&quot;           
## [11084] &quot;dreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne&quot;          
## [11085] &quot;might be; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be&quot;       
## [11086] &quot;happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower.&quot;           
## [11087] &quot;Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to HIS&quot;       
## [11088] &quot;sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival&#39;s, the reward&quot;       
## [11089] &quot;of her sister was due, and wished any thing rather than Mrs.&quot;                
## [11090] &quot;Willoughby&#39;s death.&quot;                                                         
## [11091] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11092] &quot;The shock of Colonel Brandon&#39;s errand at Barton had been much softened&quot;      
## [11093] &quot;to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm; for so great was her&quot;            
## [11094] &quot;uneasiness about Marianne, that she had already determined to set out&quot;       
## [11095] &quot;for Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further&quot;             
## [11096] &quot;intelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,&quot;        
## [11097] &quot;that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away,&quot;     
## [11098] &quot;as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection.&quot;     
## [11099] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11100] &quot;Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness of&quot;     
## [11101] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s looks and spirits proved her to be, as she repeatedly&quot;       
## [11102] &quot;declared herself, one of the happiest women in the world.  Elinor could&quot;     
## [11103] &quot;not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes&quot;          
## [11104] &quot;wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward.  But Mrs.&quot;             
## [11105] &quot;Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment&quot;       
## [11106] &quot;which Elinor had sent her, was led away by the exuberance of her joy to&quot;     
## [11107] &quot;think only of what would increase it.  Marianne was restored to her&quot;         
## [11108] &quot;from a danger in which, as she now began to feel, her own mistaken&quot;          
## [11109] &quot;judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, had&quot;       
## [11110] &quot;contributed to place her;--and in her recovery she had yet another&quot;          
## [11111] &quot;source of joy unthought of by Elinor.  It was thus imparted to her, as&quot;      
## [11112] &quot;soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred.&quot;        
## [11113] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11114] &quot;\&quot;At last we are alone.  My Elinor, you do not yet know all my&quot;              
## [11115] &quot;happiness.  Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.  He has told me so himself.\&quot;&quot;   
## [11116] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11117] &quot;Her daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised and&quot;       
## [11118] &quot;not surprised, was all silent attention.&quot;                                    
## [11119] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11120] &quot;\&quot;You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at your&quot;            
## [11121] &quot;composure now.  Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my&quot;          
## [11122] &quot;family, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon&#39;s marrying one of you as&quot;     
## [11123] &quot;the object most desirable.  And I believe Marianne will be the most&quot;         
## [11124] &quot;happy with him of the two.\&quot;&quot;                                                
## [11125] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11126] &quot;Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so, because&quot;         
## [11127] &quot;satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age,&quot;     
## [11128] &quot;characters, or feelings, could be given;--but her mother must always be&quot;     
## [11129] &quot;carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject, and&quot;             
## [11130] &quot;therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile.&quot;            
## [11131] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11132] &quot;\&quot;He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled.  It came&quot;       
## [11133] &quot;out quite unawares, quite undesignedly.  I, you may well believe, could&quot;     
## [11134] &quot;talk of nothing but my child;--he could not conceal his distress; I saw&quot;     
## [11135] &quot;that it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship,&quot;     
## [11136] &quot;as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy--or rather,&quot;     
## [11137] &quot;not thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to irresistible feelings,&quot;        
## [11138] &quot;made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant, affection for&quot;        
## [11139] &quot;Marianne.  He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since the first moment of&quot;      
## [11140] &quot;seeing her.\&quot;&quot;                                                               
## [11141] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11142] &quot;Here, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language, not the professions&quot;     
## [11143] &quot;of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her mother&#39;s&quot;          
## [11144] &quot;active fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose.&quot;    
## [11145] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11146] &quot;\&quot;His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby&quot;        
## [11147] &quot;ever felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere or&quot;                 
## [11148] &quot;constant--which ever we are to call it--has subsisted through all the&quot;       
## [11149] &quot;knowledge of dear Marianne&#39;s unhappy prepossession for that worthless&quot;       
## [11150] &quot;young man!--and without selfishness--without encouraging a hope!--could&quot;     
## [11151] &quot;he have seen her happy with another--Such a noble mind!--such openness,&quot;     
## [11152] &quot;such sincerity!--no one can be deceived in HIM.\&quot;&quot;                           
## [11153] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11154] &quot;\&quot;Colonel Brandon&#39;s character,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;as an excellent man, is&quot;     
## [11155] &quot;well established.\&quot;&quot;                                                         
## [11156] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11157] &quot;\&quot;I know it is,\&quot;--replied her mother seriously, \&quot;or after such a warning,&quot; 
## [11158] &quot;I should be the last to encourage such affection, or even to be pleased&quot;     
## [11159] &quot;by it.  But his coming for me as he did, with such active, such ready&quot;       
## [11160] &quot;friendship, is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men.\&quot;&quot;           
## [11161] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11162] &quot;\&quot;His character, however,\&quot; answered Elinor, \&quot;does not rest on ONE act of&quot;  
## [11163] &quot;kindness, to which his affection for Marianne, were humanity out of the&quot;     
## [11164] &quot;case, would have prompted him.  To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he&quot;     
## [11165] &quot;has been long and intimately known; they equally love and respect him;&quot;      
## [11166] &quot;and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired, is very&quot;           
## [11167] &quot;considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him, that if Marianne&quot;     
## [11168] &quot;can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as yourself to think our&quot;         
## [11169] &quot;connection the greatest blessing to us in the world.  What answer did&quot;       
## [11170] &quot;you give him?--Did you allow him to hope?\&quot;&quot;                                 
## [11171] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11172] &quot;\&quot;Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself.&quot;           
## [11173] &quot;Marianne might at that moment be dying.  But he did not ask for hope or&quot;     
## [11174] &quot;encouragement.  His was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible&quot;         
## [11175] &quot;effusion to a soothing friend--not an application to a parent.  Yet&quot;         
## [11176] &quot;after a time I DID say, for at first I was quite overcome--that if she&quot;      
## [11177] &quot;lived, as I trusted she might, my greatest happiness would lie in&quot;           
## [11178] &quot;promoting their marriage; and since our arrival, since our delightful&quot;       
## [11179] &quot;security, I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every&quot;        
## [11180] &quot;encouragement in my power.  Time, a very little time, I tell him, will&quot;      
## [11181] &quot;do everything;--Marianne&#39;s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a&quot;     
## [11182] &quot;man as Willoughby.-- His own merits must soon secure it.\&quot;&quot;                  
## [11183] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11184] &quot;\&quot;To judge from the Colonel&#39;s spirits, however, you have not yet made&quot;       
## [11185] &quot;him equally sanguine.\&quot;&quot;                                                     
## [11186] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11187] &quot;\&quot;No.--He thinks Marianne&#39;s affection too deeply rooted for any change&quot;      
## [11188] &quot;in it under a great length of time, and even supposing her heart again&quot;      
## [11189] &quot;free, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such a&quot;              
## [11190] &quot;difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her.  There,&quot;         
## [11191] &quot;however, he is quite mistaken.  His age is only so much beyond hers as&quot;      
## [11192] &quot;to be an advantage, as to make his character and principles fixed;--and&quot;     
## [11193] &quot;his disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very one to make&quot;       
## [11194] &quot;your sister happy.  And his person, his manners too, are all in his&quot;         
## [11195] &quot;favour.  My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not so&quot;            
## [11196] &quot;handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time, there is something much&quot;       
## [11197] &quot;more pleasing in his countenance.-- There was always a something,--if&quot;       
## [11198] &quot;you remember,--in Willoughby&#39;s eyes at times, which I did not like.\&quot;&quot;       
## [11199] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11200] &quot;Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother, without waiting for her&quot;      
## [11201] &quot;assent, continued,&quot;                                                          
## [11202] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11203] &quot;\&quot;And his manners, the Colonel&#39;s manners are not only more pleasing to&quot;      
## [11204] &quot;me than Willoughby&#39;s ever were, but they are of a kind I well know to&quot;       
## [11205] &quot;be more solidly attaching to Marianne.  Their gentleness, their genuine&quot;     
## [11206] &quot;attention to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity is much&quot;     
## [11207] &quot;more accordant with her real disposition, than the liveliness--often&quot;        
## [11208] &quot;artificial, and often ill-timed of the other.  I am very sure myself,&quot;       
## [11209] &quot;that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as he has proved&quot;          
## [11210] &quot;himself the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy with&quot;      
## [11211] &quot;HIM, as she will be with Colonel Brandon.\&quot;&quot;                                 
## [11212] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11213] &quot;She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree with her, but her&quot;           
## [11214] &quot;dissent was not heard, and therefore gave no offence.&quot;                       
## [11215] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11216] &quot;\&quot;At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me,\&quot; added Mrs.&quot;      
## [11217] &quot;Dashwood, \&quot;even if I remain at Barton; and in all probability,--for I&quot;      
## [11218] &quot;hear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly MUST be some small&quot;      
## [11219] &quot;house or cottage close by, that would suit us quite as well as our&quot;          
## [11220] &quot;present situation.\&quot;&quot;                                                        
## [11221] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11222] &quot;Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!--but&quot;       
## [11223] &quot;her spirit was stubborn.&quot;                                                    
## [11224] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11225] &quot;\&quot;His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know, everybody cares&quot;        
## [11226] &quot;about THAT;--and though I neither know nor desire to know, what it&quot;          
## [11227] &quot;really is, I am sure it must be a good one.\&quot;&quot;                               
## [11228] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11229] &quot;Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person, and&quot;           
## [11230] &quot;Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to her&quot;     
## [11231] &quot;friend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.&quot;               
## [11232] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11233] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11234] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11235] &quot;CHAPTER 46&quot;                                                                  
## [11236] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11237] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11238] &quot;Marianne&#39;s illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been long&quot;         
## [11239] &quot;enough to make her recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength, and&quot;     
## [11240] &quot;her mother&#39;s presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her&quot;     
## [11241] &quot;to remove, within four days after the arrival of the latter, into Mrs.&quot;      
## [11242] &quot;Palmer&#39;s dressing-room.  When there, at her own particular request, for&quot;     
## [11243] &quot;she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her&quot;          
## [11244] &quot;mother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her.&quot;                           
## [11245] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11246] &quot;His emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and in&quot;       
## [11247] &quot;receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him, was&quot;          
## [11248] &quot;such, as, in Elinor&#39;s conjecture, must arise from something more than&quot;       
## [11249] &quot;his affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to&quot;      
## [11250] &quot;others; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying&quot;           
## [11251] &quot;complexion as he looked at her sister, the probable recurrence of many&quot;      
## [11252] &quot;past scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblance&quot;         
## [11253] &quot;between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened&quot;       
## [11254] &quot;by the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,&quot;      
## [11255] &quot;and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.&quot;                         
## [11256] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11257] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than her daughter, but&quot;      
## [11258] &quot;with a mind very differently influenced, and therefore watching to very&quot;     
## [11259] &quot;different effect, saw nothing in the Colonel&#39;s behaviour but what arose&quot;     
## [11260] &quot;from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in the actions&quot;      
## [11261] &quot;and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something&quot;         
## [11262] &quot;more than gratitude already dawned.&quot;                                         
## [11263] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11264] &quot;At the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly stronger&quot;         
## [11265] &quot;every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her own and her&quot;         
## [11266] &quot;daughter&#39;s wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton.  On HER&quot;             
## [11267] &quot;measures depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could not&quot;         
## [11268] &quot;quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods&#39; stay; and Colonel Brandon was soon&quot;     
## [11269] &quot;brought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there as&quot;        
## [11270] &quot;equally determinate, if not equally indispensable.  At his and Mrs.&quot;         
## [11271] &quot;Jennings&#39;s united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to&quot;      
## [11272] &quot;accept the use of his carriage on her journey back, for the better&quot;          
## [11273] &quot;accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel, at the joint&quot;              
## [11274] &quot;invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active good-nature&quot;     
## [11275] &quot;made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself,&quot;       
## [11276] &quot;engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the&quot;        
## [11277] &quot;course of a few weeks.&quot;                                                      
## [11278] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11279] &quot;The day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after taking&quot;     
## [11280] &quot;so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly&quot;     
## [11281] &quot;grateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own&quot;       
## [11282] &quot;heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding&quot;         
## [11283] &quot;Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefully&quot;       
## [11284] &quot;assisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed anxious that she&quot;      
## [11285] &quot;should engross at least half.  Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed,&quot;      
## [11286] &quot;and the others were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers, and&quot;      
## [11287] &quot;feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise&quot;      
## [11288] &quot;to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young&quot;     
## [11289] &quot;companions; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his&quot;             
## [11290] &quot;solitary way to Delaford.&quot;                                                   
## [11291] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11292] &quot;The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journey&quot;      
## [11293] &quot;on both, without essential fatigue.  Every thing that the most zealous&quot;      
## [11294] &quot;affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable,&quot;     
## [11295] &quot;was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward&quot;      
## [11296] &quot;in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits.  To Elinor, the&quot;            
## [11297] &quot;observation of the latter was particularly grateful.  She, who had seen&quot;     
## [11298] &quot;her week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of&quot;        
## [11299] &quot;heart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude to&quot;           
## [11300] &quot;conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, an&quot;         
## [11301] &quot;apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she trusted&quot;       
## [11302] &quot;of serious reflection, must eventually lead her to contentment and&quot;          
## [11303] &quot;cheerfulness.&quot;                                                               
## [11304] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11305] &quot;As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which every&quot;     
## [11306] &quot;field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection,&quot;      
## [11307] &quot;she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their&quot;        
## [11308] &quot;notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window.  But here, Elinor&quot;          
## [11309] &quot;could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she assisted&quot;           
## [11310] &quot;Marianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw only an&quot;       
## [11311] &quot;emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,&quot;     
## [11312] &quot;and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.  In the whole of her&quot;         
## [11313] &quot;subsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened to&quot;           
## [11314] &quot;reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common&quot;            
## [11315] &quot;sitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of&quot;        
## [11316] &quot;resolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the&quot;      
## [11317] &quot;sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be&quot;     
## [11318] &quot;connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness,&quot;      
## [11319] &quot;and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away without&quot;       
## [11320] &quot;the atonement of a smile.  After dinner she would try her piano-forte.&quot;      
## [11321] &quot;She went to it; but the music on which her eye first rested was an&quot;          
## [11322] &quot;opera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their&quot;             
## [11323] &quot;favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his&quot;        
## [11324] &quot;hand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head, put the music&quot;        
## [11325] &quot;aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained of&quot;          
## [11326] &quot;feebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaring&quot;       
## [11327] &quot;however with firmness as she did so, that she should in future practice&quot;     
## [11328] &quot;much.&quot;                                                                       
## [11329] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11330] &quot;The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms.  On the&quot;     
## [11331] &quot;contrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked&quot;       
## [11332] &quot;and spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of&quot;            
## [11333] &quot;Margaret&#39;s return, and talking of the dear family party which would&quot;         
## [11334] &quot;then be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as the&quot;     
## [11335] &quot;only happiness worth a wish.&quot;                                                
## [11336] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11337] &quot;\&quot;When the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength,\&quot; said&quot;     
## [11338] &quot;she, \&quot;we will take long walks together every day.  We will walk to the&quot;     
## [11339] &quot;farm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will&quot;       
## [11340] &quot;walk to Sir John&#39;s new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;&quot;      
## [11341] &quot;and we will often go to the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its&quot;   
## [11342] &quot;foundations as far as we are told they once reached.  I know we shall&quot;       
## [11343] &quot;be happy.  I know the summer will pass happily away.  I mean never to&quot;       
## [11344] &quot;be later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall&quot;         
## [11345] &quot;divide every moment between music and reading.  I have formed my plan,&quot;      
## [11346] &quot;and am determined to enter on a course of serious study.  Our own&quot;           
## [11347] &quot;library is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing beyond&quot;     
## [11348] &quot;mere amusement.  But there are many works well worth reading at the&quot;         
## [11349] &quot;Park; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can&quot;     
## [11350] &quot;borrow of Colonel Brandon.  By reading only six hours a-day, I shall&quot;        
## [11351] &quot;gain in the course of a twelve-month a great deal of instruction which&quot;      
## [11352] &quot;I now feel myself to want.\&quot;&quot;                                                
## [11353] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11354] &quot;Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this;&quot;           
## [11355] &quot;though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her&quot;       
## [11356] &quot;to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work&quot;       
## [11357] &quot;in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and&quot;         
## [11358] &quot;virtuous self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she&quot;         
## [11359] &quot;remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared&quot;       
## [11360] &quot;she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of&quot;          
## [11361] &quot;Marianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy&quot;           
## [11362] &quot;tranquillity.  Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved&quot;       
## [11363] &quot;to wait till her sister&#39;s health were more secure, before she appointed&quot;     
## [11364] &quot;it.  But the resolution was made only to be broken.&quot;                         
## [11365] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11366] &quot;Marianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was&quot;         
## [11367] &quot;fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out.  But at last a&quot;      
## [11368] &quot;soft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter&#39;s&quot;           
## [11369] &quot;wishes and the mother&#39;s confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor&#39;s&quot;       
## [11370] &quot;arm, was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue, in&quot;        
## [11371] &quot;the lane before the house.&quot;                                                  
## [11372] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11373] &quot;The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an&quot;     
## [11374] &quot;exercise hitherto untried since her illness required;--and they had&quot;         
## [11375] &quot;advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the&quot;        
## [11376] &quot;hill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes turned&quot;          
## [11377] &quot;towards it, Marianne calmly said,&quot;                                           
## [11378] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11379] &quot;\&quot;There, exactly there,\&quot;--pointing with one hand, \&quot;on that projecting&quot;     
## [11380] &quot;mound,--there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby.\&quot;&quot;                   
## [11381] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11382] &quot;Her voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,&quot;             
## [11383] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11384] &quot;\&quot;I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the&quot;          
## [11385] &quot;spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?\&quot;--hesitatingly it&quot;       
## [11386] &quot;was said.--\&quot;Or will it be wrong?--I can talk of it now, I hope, as I&quot;       
## [11387] &quot;ought to do.\&quot;--&quot;                                                            
## [11388] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11389] &quot;Elinor tenderly invited her to be open.&quot;                                     
## [11390] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11391] &quot;\&quot;As for regret,\&quot; said Marianne, \&quot;I have done with that, as far as HE is&quot;  
## [11392] &quot;concerned.  I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been&quot;      
## [11393] &quot;for him, but what they are NOW.--At present, if I could be satisfied on&quot;     
## [11394] &quot;one point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS acting&quot;     
## [11395] &quot;a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all, if I could be assured&quot;      
## [11396] &quot;that he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied&quot;         
## [11397] &quot;him, since the story of that unfortunate girl\&quot;--&quot;                           
## [11398] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11399] &quot;She stopt.  Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered,&quot;            
## [11400] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11401] &quot;\&quot;If you could be assured of that, you think you should be easy.\&quot;&quot;          
## [11402] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11403] &quot;\&quot;Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;--for not only is it&quot;       
## [11404] &quot;horrible to suspect a person, who has been what HE has been to ME, of&quot;       
## [11405] &quot;such designs,--but what must it make me appear to myself?--What in a&quot;        
## [11406] &quot;situation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could&quot;        
## [11407] &quot;expose me to\&quot;--&quot;                                                            
## [11408] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11409] &quot;\&quot;How then,\&quot; asked her sister, \&quot;would you account for his behaviour?\&quot;&quot;    
## [11410] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11411] &quot;\&quot;I would suppose him,--Oh, how gladly would I suppose him, only fickle,&quot;    
## [11412] &quot;very, very fickle.\&quot;&quot;                                                        
## [11413] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11414] &quot;Elinor said no more.  She was debating within herself on the&quot;                
## [11415] &quot;eligibility of beginning her story directly, or postponing it till&quot;          
## [11416] &quot;Marianne were in stronger health;--and they crept on for a few minutes&quot;      
## [11417] &quot;in silence.&quot;                                                                 
## [11418] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11419] &quot;\&quot;I am not wishing him too much good,\&quot; said Marianne at last with a&quot;        
## [11420] &quot;sigh, \&quot;when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant&quot;        
## [11421] &quot;than my own.  He will suffer enough in them.\&quot;&quot;                              
## [11422] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11423] &quot;\&quot;Do you compare your conduct with his?\&quot;&quot;                                   
## [11424] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11425] &quot;\&quot;No. I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it with&quot;       
## [11426] &quot;yours.\&quot;&quot;                                                                    
## [11427] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11428] &quot;\&quot;Our situations have borne little resemblance.\&quot;&quot;                           
## [11429] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11430] &quot;\&quot;They have borne more than our conduct.--Do not, my dearest Elinor, let&quot;    
## [11431] &quot;your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure.  My&quot;            
## [11432] &quot;illness has made me think-- It has given me leisure and calmness for&quot;        
## [11433] &quot;serious recollection.  Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I&quot;        
## [11434] &quot;was perfectly able to reflect.  I considered the past: I saw in my own&quot;      
## [11435] &quot;behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last&quot;            
## [11436] &quot;autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of&quot;      
## [11437] &quot;kindness to others.  I saw that my own feelings had prepared my&quot;             
## [11438] &quot;sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me&quot;      
## [11439] &quot;to the grave.  My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by&quot;     
## [11440] &quot;myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the&quot;       
## [11441] &quot;time to be wrong.  Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I&quot;      
## [11442] &quot;did not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such&quot;           
## [11443] &quot;feelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,--wonder&quot;     
## [11444] &quot;that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for&quot;              
## [11445] &quot;atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once.  Had I&quot;        
## [11446] &quot;died,--in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my&quot;         
## [11447] &quot;friend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my&quot;     
## [11448] &quot;latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!--How should&quot;      
## [11449] &quot;I have lived in YOUR remembrance!--My mother too! How could you have&quot;        
## [11450] &quot;consoled her!--I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.  Whenever&quot;      
## [11451] &quot;I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing&quot;       
## [11452] &quot;indulged.  Every body seemed injured by me.  The kindness, the&quot;              
## [11453] &quot;unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful&quot;           
## [11454] &quot;contempt.  To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every&quot;         
## [11455] &quot;common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart&quot;      
## [11456] &quot;hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very&quot;         
## [11457] &quot;attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them, little as they&quot;           
## [11458] &quot;deserve, I had given less than their due.  But you,--you above all,&quot;         
## [11459] &quot;above my mother, had been wronged by me.  I, and only I, knew your&quot;          
## [11460] &quot;heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any&quot;         
## [11461] &quot;compassion that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was before&quot;       
## [11462] &quot;me; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate of you and your comfort?&quot;     
## [11463] &quot;Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking&quot;        
## [11464] &quot;any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular&quot;             
## [11465] &quot;gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge&quot;                     
## [11466] &quot;alone?--No;--not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had&quot;        
## [11467] &quot;believed you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or&quot;        
## [11468] &quot;friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting&quot;       
## [11469] &quot;only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for&quot;     
## [11470] &quot;whom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake.\&quot;&quot;     
## [11471] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11472] &quot;Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor,&quot;        
## [11473] &quot;impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly&quot;       
## [11474] &quot;that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well&quot;      
## [11475] &quot;deserved.  Marianne pressed her hand and replied,&quot;                           
## [11476] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11477] &quot;\&quot;You are very good.--The future must be my proof.  I have laid down my&quot;     
## [11478] &quot;plan, and if I am capable of adhering to it--my feelings shall be&quot;           
## [11479] &quot;governed and my temper improved.  They shall no longer worry others,&quot;        
## [11480] &quot;nor torture myself.  I shall now live solely for my family.  You, my&quot;        
## [11481] &quot;mother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you will&quot;      
## [11482] &quot;share my affections entirely between you.  From you, from my home, I&quot;        
## [11483] &quot;shall never again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do mix&quot;     
## [11484] &quot;in other society, it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled, my&quot;     
## [11485] &quot;heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the lesser&quot;           
## [11486] &quot;duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance.  As for Willoughby--to&quot;     
## [11487] &quot;say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him, would be idle.&quot;       
## [11488] &quot;His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or&quot;            
## [11489] &quot;opinions.  But it shall be regulated, it shall be checked by religion,&quot;      
## [11490] &quot;by reason, by constant employment.\&quot;&quot;                                        
## [11491] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11492] &quot;She paused--and added in a low voice, \&quot;If I could but know HIS heart,&quot;      
## [11493] &quot;everything would become easy.\&quot;&quot;                                             
## [11494] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11495] &quot;Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or&quot;       
## [11496] &quot;impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at all&quot;     
## [11497] &quot;nearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as&quot;           
## [11498] &quot;reflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself&quot;          
## [11499] &quot;leading to the fact.&quot;                                                        
## [11500] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11501] &quot;She managed the recital, as she hoped, with address; prepared her&quot;           
## [11502] &quot;anxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chief&quot;        
## [11503] &quot;points on which Willoughby grounded his apology; did justice to his&quot;         
## [11504] &quot;repentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard.&quot;          
## [11505] &quot;Marianne said not a word.--She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the&quot;         
## [11506] &quot;ground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them.  A&quot;     
## [11507] &quot;thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge&quot;         
## [11508] &quot;one.  She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,&quot;           
## [11509] &quot;unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister&#39;s, and tears covered&quot;     
## [11510] &quot;her cheeks.&quot;                                                                 
## [11511] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11512] &quot;Elinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home; and till they&quot;       
## [11513] &quot;reached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her curiosity&quot;     
## [11514] &quot;must be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of nothing&quot;      
## [11515] &quot;but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was carefully&quot;          
## [11516] &quot;minute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could&quot;       
## [11517] &quot;be safely indulged.  As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a&quot;     
## [11518] &quot;kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her&quot;           
## [11519] &quot;tears, \&quot;Tell mama,\&quot; withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up&quot;         
## [11520] &quot;stairs.  Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable&quot;       
## [11521] &quot;as what she now sought; and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its&quot;         
## [11522] &quot;result, and a resolution of reviving the subject again, should Marianne&quot;     
## [11523] &quot;fail to do it, she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting&quot;           
## [11524] &quot;injunction.&quot;                                                                 
## [11525] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11526] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11527] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11528] &quot;CHAPTER 47&quot;                                                                  
## [11529] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11530] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11531] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former&quot;            
## [11532] &quot;favourite.  She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his&quot;         
## [11533] &quot;imputed guilt;--she was sorry for him;--she wished him happy.  But the&quot;      
## [11534] &quot;feelings of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore him&quot;      
## [11535] &quot;with a faith unbroken--a character unblemished, to Marianne.  Nothing&quot;       
## [11536] &quot;could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his&quot;     
## [11537] &quot;means, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza.  Nothing&quot;          
## [11538] &quot;could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure the&quot;          
## [11539] &quot;interests of Colonel Brandon.&quot;                                               
## [11540] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11541] &quot;Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby&#39;s story from&quot;         
## [11542] &quot;himself--had she witnessed his distress, and been under the influence&quot;       
## [11543] &quot;of his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassion&quot;       
## [11544] &quot;would have been greater.  But it was neither in Elinor&#39;s power, nor in&quot;      
## [11545] &quot;her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailed&quot;                
## [11546] &quot;explanation, as had at first been called forth in herself.  Reflection&quot;      
## [11547] &quot;had given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion of&quot;          
## [11548] &quot;Willoughby&#39;s deserts;--she wished, therefore, to declare only the&quot;           
## [11549] &quot;simple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his&quot;             
## [11550] &quot;character, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy&quot;        
## [11551] &quot;astray.&quot;                                                                     
## [11552] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11553] &quot;In the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began&quot;           
## [11554] &quot;voluntarily to speak of him again;--but that it was not without an&quot;          
## [11555] &quot;effort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for&quot;      
## [11556] &quot;some time previously sitting--her rising colour, as she spoke,--and her&quot;     
## [11557] &quot;unsteady voice, plainly shewed.&quot;                                             
## [11558] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11559] &quot;\&quot;I wish to assure you both,\&quot; said she, \&quot;that I see every thing--as you&quot;   
## [11560] &quot;can desire me to do.\&quot;&quot;                                                      
## [11561] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11562] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing&quot;            
## [11563] &quot;tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her sister&#39;s&quot;          
## [11564] &quot;unbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her silence.  Marianne&quot;          
## [11565] &quot;slowly continued--&quot;                                                          
## [11566] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11567] &quot;\&quot;It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told me this morning--I have&quot;      
## [11568] &quot;now heard exactly what I wished to hear.\&quot;--For some moments her voice&quot;      
## [11569] &quot;was lost; but recovering herself, she added, and with greater calmness&quot;      
## [11570] &quot;than before--\&quot;I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change.  I&quot;       
## [11571] &quot;never could have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or later&quot;     
## [11572] &quot;I must have known, all this.--I should have had no confidence, no&quot;           
## [11573] &quot;esteem.  Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.\&quot;&quot;                  
## [11574] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11575] &quot;\&quot;I know it--I know it,\&quot; cried her mother.  \&quot;Happy with a man of&quot;          
## [11576] &quot;libertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest&quot;      
## [11577] &quot;of our friends, and the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heart&quot;       
## [11578] &quot;to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her sensitive&quot;            
## [11579] &quot;conscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her husband&quot;          
## [11580] &quot;ought to have felt.\&quot;&quot;                                                       
## [11581] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11582] &quot;Marianne sighed, and repeated, \&quot;I wish for no change.\&quot;&quot;                    
## [11583] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11584] &quot;\&quot;You consider the matter,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;exactly as a good mind and a&quot;    
## [11585] &quot;sound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as&quot;       
## [11586] &quot;well as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,&quot;          
## [11587] &quot;reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you&quot;     
## [11588] &quot;in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would have&quot;       
## [11589] &quot;been poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less certain.&quot;      
## [11590] &quot;Had you married, you must have been always poor.  His expensiveness is&quot;      
## [11591] &quot;acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares that&quot;           
## [11592] &quot;self-denial is a word hardly understood by him.  His demands and your&quot;       
## [11593] &quot;inexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought&quot;     
## [11594] &quot;on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you, from having&quot;      
## [11595] &quot;been entirely unknown and unthought of before.  YOUR sense of honour&quot;        
## [11596] &quot;and honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation,&quot;       
## [11597] &quot;to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and,&quot;          
## [11598] &quot;perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,&quot;     
## [11599] &quot;you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--and how&quot;       
## [11600] &quot;little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin&quot;       
## [11601] &quot;which had begun before your marriage?-- Beyond THAT, had you&quot;                
## [11602] &quot;endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not&quot;       
## [11603] &quot;to be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to&quot;          
## [11604] &quot;consent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his heart,&quot;     
## [11605] &quot;and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such&quot;           
## [11606] &quot;difficulties?\&quot;&quot;                                                             
## [11607] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11608] &quot;Marianne&#39;s lips quivered, and she repeated the word \&quot;Selfish?\&quot; in a&quot;       
## [11609] &quot;tone that implied--\&quot;do you really think him selfish?\&quot;&quot;                     
## [11610] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11611] &quot;\&quot;The whole of his behaviour,\&quot; replied Elinor, \&quot;from the beginning to&quot;     
## [11612] &quot;the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness.  It was&quot;            
## [11613] &quot;selfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which&quot;          
## [11614] &quot;afterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession of&quot;     
## [11615] &quot;it, and which finally carried him from Barton.  His own enjoyment, or&quot;       
## [11616] &quot;his own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle.\&quot;&quot;             
## [11617] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11618] &quot;\&quot;It is very true.  MY happiness never was his object.\&quot;&quot;                    
## [11619] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11620] &quot;\&quot;At present,\&quot; continued Elinor, \&quot;he regrets what he has done.  And why&quot;   
## [11621] &quot;does he regret it?--Because he finds it has not answered towards&quot;            
## [11622] &quot;himself.  It has not made him happy.  His circumstances are now&quot;             
## [11623] &quot;unembarrassed--he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only&quot;     
## [11624] &quot;that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself.&quot;         
## [11625] &quot;But does it follow that had he married you, he would have been&quot;              
## [11626] &quot;happy?--The inconveniences would have been different.  He would then&quot;        
## [11627] &quot;have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they are&quot;        
## [11628] &quot;removed, he now reckons as nothing.  He would have had a wife of whose&quot;      
## [11629] &quot;temper he could make no complaint, but he would have been always&quot;            
## [11630] &quot;necessitous--always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank&quot;      
## [11631] &quot;the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far&quot;        
## [11632] &quot;more importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a&quot;      
## [11633] &quot;wife.\&quot;&quot;                                                                     
## [11634] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11635] &quot;\&quot;I have not a doubt of it,\&quot; said Marianne; \&quot;and I have nothing to&quot;        
## [11636] &quot;regret--nothing but my own folly.\&quot;&quot;                                         
## [11637] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11638] &quot;\&quot;Rather say your mother&#39;s imprudence, my child,\&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood;&quot;      
## [11639] &quot;\&quot;SHE must be answerable.\&quot;&quot;                                                 
## [11640] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11641] &quot;Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor, satisfied that each&quot;        
## [11642] &quot;felt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that might&quot;     
## [11643] &quot;weaken her sister&#39;s spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first&quot;             
## [11644] &quot;subject, immediately continued,&quot;                                             
## [11645] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11646] &quot;\&quot;One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the&quot;       
## [11647] &quot;story--that all Willoughby&#39;s difficulties have arisen from the first&quot;        
## [11648] &quot;offence against virtue, in his behaviour to Eliza Williams.  That crime&quot;     
## [11649] &quot;has been the origin of every lesser one, and of all his present&quot;             
## [11650] &quot;discontents.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
## [11651] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11652] &quot;Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark; and her mother was led&quot;      
## [11653] &quot;by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon&#39;s injuries and merits, warm&quot;      
## [11654] &quot;as friendship and design could unitedly dictate.  Her daughter did not&quot;      
## [11655] &quot;look, however, as if much of it were heard by her.&quot;                          
## [11656] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11657] &quot;Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two or three following&quot;     
## [11658] &quot;days, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done;&quot;      
## [11659] &quot;but while her resolution was unsubdued, and she still tried to appear&quot;       
## [11660] &quot;cheerful and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect of time&quot;      
## [11661] &quot;upon her health.&quot;                                                            
## [11662] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11663] &quot;Margaret returned, and the family were again all restored to each&quot;           
## [11664] &quot;other, again quietly settled at the cottage; and if not pursuing their&quot;      
## [11665] &quot;usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to&quot;          
## [11666] &quot;Barton, at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.&quot;         
## [11667] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11668] &quot;Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward.  She had heard&quot;            
## [11669] &quot;nothing of him since her leaving London, nothing new of his plans,&quot;          
## [11670] &quot;nothing certain even of his present abode.  Some letters had passed&quot;         
## [11671] &quot;between her and her brother, in consequence of Marianne&#39;s illness; and&quot;      
## [11672] &quot;in the first of John&#39;s, there had been this sentence:-- \&quot;We know&quot;           
## [11673] &quot;nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so&quot;          
## [11674] &quot;prohibited a subject, but conclude him to be still at Oxford;\&quot; which&quot;       
## [11675] &quot;was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence,&quot;      
## [11676] &quot;for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.&quot;       
## [11677] &quot;She was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his measures.&quot;       
## [11678] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11679] &quot;Their man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; and&quot;      
## [11680] &quot;when, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of his&quot;          
## [11681] &quot;mistress as to the event of his errand, this was his voluntary&quot;              
## [11682] &quot;communication--&quot;                                                             
## [11683] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11684] &quot;\&quot;I suppose you know, ma&#39;am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.\&quot;&quot;                 
## [11685] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11686] &quot;Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw her&quot;          
## [11687] &quot;turning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics.  Mrs. Dashwood,&quot;      
## [11688] &quot;whose eyes, as she answered the servant&#39;s inquiry, had intuitively&quot;          
## [11689] &quot;taken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor&#39;s&quot;               
## [11690] &quot;countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment afterwards,&quot;          
## [11691] &quot;alike distressed by Marianne&#39;s situation, knew not on which child to&quot;        
## [11692] &quot;bestow her principal attention.&quot;                                             
## [11693] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11694] &quot;The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense&quot;       
## [11695] &quot;enough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s assistance,&quot;      
## [11696] &quot;supported her into the other room.  By that time, Marianne was rather&quot;       
## [11697] &quot;better, and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the&quot;          
## [11698] &quot;maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so far&quot;     
## [11699] &quot;recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an&quot;        
## [11700] &quot;inquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his intelligence.  Mrs. Dashwood&quot;     
## [11701] &quot;immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor had the&quot;            
## [11702] &quot;benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.&quot;              
## [11703] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11704] &quot;\&quot;Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?\&quot;&quot;                      
## [11705] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11706] &quot;\&quot;I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma&#39;am, this morning in Exeter, and his lady&quot;     
## [11707] &quot;too, Miss Steele as was.  They was stopping in a chaise at the door of&quot;      
## [11708] &quot;the New London Inn, as I went there with a message from Sally at the&quot;        
## [11709] &quot;Park to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened to look up&quot;     
## [11710] &quot;as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss&quot;     
## [11711] &quot;Steele; so I took off my hat, and she knew me and called to me, and&quot;         
## [11712] &quot;inquired after you, ma&#39;am, and the young ladies, especially Miss&quot;            
## [11713] &quot;Marianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars&#39;s,&quot;       
## [11714] &quot;their best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had not&quot;     
## [11715] &quot;time to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go&quot;            
## [11716] &quot;forwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but&quot;           
## [11717] &quot;howsever, when they come back, they&#39;d make sure to come and see you.\&quot;&quot;      
## [11718] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11719] &quot;\&quot;But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?\&quot;&quot;                           
## [11720] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11721] &quot;\&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am. She smiled, and said how she had changed her name since&quot;       
## [11722] &quot;she was in these parts.  She was always a very affable and free-spoken&quot;      
## [11723] &quot;young lady, and very civil behaved.  So, I made free to wish her joy.\&quot;&quot;     
## [11724] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11725] &quot;\&quot;Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?\&quot;&quot;                               
## [11726] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11727] &quot;\&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am, I just see him leaning back in it, but he did not look&quot;        
## [11728] &quot;up;--he never was a gentleman much for talking.\&quot;&quot;                           
## [11729] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11730] &quot;Elinor&#39;s heart could easily account for his not putting himself&quot;             
## [11731] &quot;forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.&quot;             
## [11732] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11733] &quot;\&quot;Was there no one else in the carriage?\&quot;&quot;                                  
## [11734] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11735] &quot;\&quot;No, ma&#39;am, only they two.\&quot;&quot;                                               
## [11736] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11737] &quot;\&quot;Do you know where they came from?\&quot;&quot;                                       
## [11738] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11739] &quot;\&quot;They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--Mrs. Ferrars told me.\&quot;&quot;       
## [11740] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11741] &quot;\&quot;And are they going farther westward?\&quot;&quot;                                    
## [11742] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11743] &quot;\&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am--but not to bide long.  They will soon be back again, and&quot;      
## [11744] &quot;then they&#39;d be sure and call here.\&quot;&quot;                                        
## [11745] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11746] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter; but Elinor knew better than&quot;       
## [11747] &quot;to expect them.  She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and&quot;       
## [11748] &quot;was very confident that Edward would never come near them.  She&quot;             
## [11749] &quot;observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they were probably going&quot;       
## [11750] &quot;down to Mr. Pratt&#39;s, near Plymouth.&quot;                                         
## [11751] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11752] &quot;Thomas&#39;s intelligence seemed over.  Elinor looked as if she wished to&quot;       
## [11753] &quot;hear more.&quot;                                                                  
## [11754] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11755] &quot;\&quot;Did you see them off, before you came away?\&quot;&quot;                             
## [11756] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11757] &quot;\&quot;No, ma&#39;am--the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any&quot;      
## [11758] &quot;longer; I was afraid of being late.\&quot;&quot;                                       
## [11759] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11760] &quot;\&quot;Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?\&quot;&quot;                                             
## [11761] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11762] &quot;\&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am, she said how she was very well; and to my mind she was&quot;        
## [11763] &quot;always a very handsome young lady--and she seemed vastly contented.\&quot;&quot;       
## [11764] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11765] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the&quot;          
## [11766] &quot;tablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed.&quot;             
## [11767] &quot;Marianne had already sent to say, that she should eat nothing more.&quot;         
## [11768] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s and Elinor&#39;s appetites were equally lost, and Margaret&quot;      
## [11769] &quot;might think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as both&quot;     
## [11770] &quot;her sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had often&quot;        
## [11771] &quot;had to be careless of their meals, she had never been obliged to go&quot;         
## [11772] &quot;without her dinner before.&quot;                                                  
## [11773] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11774] &quot;When the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and&quot;          
## [11775] &quot;Elinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a&quot;            
## [11776] &quot;similarity of thoughtfulness and silence.  Mrs. Dashwood feared to&quot;          
## [11777] &quot;hazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation.  She now&quot;          
## [11778] &quot;found that she had erred in relying on Elinor&#39;s representation of&quot;           
## [11779] &quot;herself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly&quot;           
## [11780] &quot;softened at the time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness,&quot;         
## [11781] &quot;suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne.  She found that she&quot;        
## [11782] &quot;had been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of her&quot;            
## [11783] &quot;daughter, to think the attachment, which once she had so well&quot;               
## [11784] &quot;understood, much slighter in reality, than she had been wont to&quot;             
## [11785] &quot;believe, or than it was now proved to be.  She feared that under this&quot;       
## [11786] &quot;persuasion she had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her&quot;     
## [11787] &quot;Elinor;--that Marianne&#39;s affliction, because more acknowledged, more&quot;        
## [11788] &quot;immediately before her, had too much engrossed her tenderness, and led&quot;      
## [11789] &quot;her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering&quot;       
## [11790] &quot;almost as much, certainly with less self-provocation, and greater&quot;           
## [11791] &quot;fortitude.&quot;

## [11798] &quot;Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an&quot;               
## [11799] &quot;unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it,&quot;      
## [11800] &quot;and certainty itself.  She now found, that in spite of herself, she had&quot;     
## [11801] &quot;always admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something&quot;        
## [11802] &quot;would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of his&quot;       
## [11803] &quot;own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of&quot;        
## [11804] &quot;establishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of all.&quot;     
## [11805] &quot;But he was now married; and she condemned her heart for the lurking&quot;         
## [11806] &quot;flattery, which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.&quot;            
## [11807] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11808] &quot;That he should be married soon, before (as she imagined) he could be in&quot;     
## [11809] &quot;orders, and consequently before he could be in possession of the&quot;            
## [11810] &quot;living, surprised her a little at first.  But she soon saw how likely&quot;       
## [11811] &quot;it was that Lucy, in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure&quot;        
## [11812] &quot;him, should overlook every thing but the risk of delay.  They were&quot;          
## [11813] &quot;married, married in town, and now hastening down to her uncle&#39;s.  What&quot;      
## [11814] &quot;had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing her&quot;       
## [11815] &quot;mother&#39;s servant, on hearing Lucy&#39;s message!&quot;                                
## [11816] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11817] &quot;They would soon, she supposed, be settled at Delaford.--Delaford,--that&quot;     
## [11818] &quot;place in which so much conspired to give her an interest; which she&quot;         
## [11819] &quot;wished to be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid.  She saw them&quot;       
## [11820] &quot;in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw in Lucy, the active,&quot;            
## [11821] &quot;contriving manager, uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with&quot;       
## [11822] &quot;the utmost frugality, and ashamed to be suspected of half her&quot;               
## [11823] &quot;economical practices;--pursuing her own interest in every thought,&quot;          
## [11824] &quot;courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every&quot;      
## [11825] &quot;wealthy friend.  In Edward--she knew not what she saw, nor what she&quot;         
## [11826] &quot;wished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing pleased her; she turned away&quot;     
## [11827] &quot;her head from every sketch of him.&quot;                                          
## [11828] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11829] &quot;Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London&quot;       
## [11830] &quot;would write to them to announce the event, and give farther&quot;                 
## [11831] &quot;particulars,--but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no&quot;       
## [11832] &quot;tidings.  Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found fault&quot;      
## [11833] &quot;with every absent friend.  They were all thoughtless or indolent.&quot;           
## [11834] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11835] &quot;\&quot;When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma&#39;am?\&quot; was an inquiry which&quot;       
## [11836] &quot;sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on.&quot;          
## [11837] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11838] &quot;\&quot;I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to&quot;     
## [11839] &quot;hear from him again.  I earnestly pressed his coming to us, and should&quot;      
## [11840] &quot;not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.\&quot;&quot;        
## [11841] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11842] &quot;This was gaining something, something to look forward to.  Colonel&quot;          
## [11843] &quot;Brandon must have some information to give.&quot;                                 
## [11844] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11845] &quot;Scarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man on&quot;              
## [11846] &quot;horseback drew her eyes to the window.  He stopt at their gate.  It was&quot;     
## [11847] &quot;a gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself.  Now she could hear more;&quot;      
## [11848] &quot;and she trembled in expectation of it.  But--it was NOT Colonel&quot;             
## [11849] &quot;Brandon--neither his air--nor his height.  Were it possible, she must&quot;       
## [11850] &quot;say it must be Edward.  She looked again.  He had just dismounted;--she&quot;     
## [11851] &quot;could not be mistaken,--it WAS Edward.  She moved away and sat down.&quot;        
## [11852] &quot;\&quot;He comes from Mr. Pratt&#39;s purposely to see us.  I WILL be calm; I WILL&quot;    
## [11853] &quot;be mistress of myself.\&quot;&quot;                                                    
## [11854] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11855] &quot;In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the&quot;        
## [11856] &quot;mistake.  She saw her mother and Marianne change colour; saw them look&quot;      
## [11857] &quot;at herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other.  She would have&quot;      
## [11858] &quot;given the world to be able to speak--and to make them understand that&quot;       
## [11859] &quot;she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear in their behaviour to&quot;        
## [11860] &quot;him;--but she had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to their&quot;       
## [11861] &quot;own discretion.&quot;                                                             
## [11862] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11863] &quot;Not a syllable passed aloud.  They all waited in silence for the&quot;            
## [11864] &quot;appearance of their visitor.  His footsteps were heard along the gravel&quot;     
## [11865] &quot;path; in a moment he was in the passage, and in another he was before&quot;       
## [11866] &quot;them.&quot;                                                                       
## [11867] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11868] &quot;His countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even for&quot;        
## [11869] &quot;Elinor.  His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as if&quot;       
## [11870] &quot;fearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.&quot;        
## [11871] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted, to the wishes of&quot;        
## [11872] &quot;that daughter, by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be&quot;      
## [11873] &quot;guided in every thing, met with a look of forced complacency, gave him&quot;      
## [11874] &quot;her hand, and wished him joy.&quot;                                               
## [11875] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11876] &quot;He coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply.  Elinor&#39;s lips&quot;      
## [11877] &quot;had moved with her mother&#39;s, and, when the moment of action was over,&quot;       
## [11878] &quot;she wished that she had shaken hands with him too.  But it was then too&quot;     
## [11879] &quot;late, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again and&quot;     
## [11880] &quot;talked of the weather.&quot;                                                      
## [11881] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11882] &quot;Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal her&quot;     
## [11883] &quot;distress; and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole of&quot;       
## [11884] &quot;the case, thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore&quot;        
## [11885] &quot;took a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained a strict&quot;           
## [11886] &quot;silence.&quot;                                                                    
## [11887] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11888] &quot;When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very&quot;      
## [11889] &quot;awful pause took place.  It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who&quot;         
## [11890] &quot;felt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well.  In a&quot;         
## [11891] &quot;hurried manner, he replied in the affirmative.&quot;                              
## [11892] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11893] &quot;Another pause.&quot;                                                              
## [11894] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11895] &quot;Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her own&quot;      
## [11896] &quot;voice, now said,&quot;                                                            
## [11897] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11898] &quot;\&quot;Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?\&quot;&quot;                                          
## [11899] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11900] &quot;\&quot;At Longstaple!\&quot; he replied, with an air of surprise.-- \&quot;No, my mother&quot;   
## [11901] &quot;is in town.\&quot;&quot;                                                               
## [11902] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11903] &quot;\&quot;I meant,\&quot; said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, \&quot;to inquire&quot;  
## [11904] &quot;for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars.\&quot;&quot;                                                  
## [11905] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11906] &quot;She dared not look up;--but her mother and Marianne both turned their&quot;       
## [11907] &quot;eyes on him.  He coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and,&quot;        
## [11908] &quot;after some hesitation, said,--&quot;                                              
## [11909] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11910] &quot;\&quot;Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs. ROBERT Ferrars.\&quot;&quot;       
## [11911] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11912] &quot;\&quot;Mrs. Robert Ferrars!\&quot;--was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an&quot;     
## [11913] &quot;accent of the utmost amazement;--and though Elinor could not speak,&quot;         
## [11914] &quot;even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder.  He&quot;         
## [11915] &quot;rose from his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not&quot;           
## [11916] &quot;knowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and&quot;          
## [11917] &quot;while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to&quot;          
## [11918] &quot;pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,&quot;                               
## [11919] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11920] &quot;\&quot;Perhaps you do not know--you may not have heard that my brother is&quot;        
## [11921] &quot;lately married to--to the youngest--to Miss Lucy Steele.\&quot;&quot;                  
## [11922] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11923] &quot;His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor,&quot;      
## [11924] &quot;who sat with her head leaning over her work, in a state of such&quot;             
## [11925] &quot;agitation as made her hardly know where she was.&quot;                            
## [11926] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11927] &quot;\&quot;Yes,\&quot; said he, \&quot;they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish.\&quot;&quot;  
## [11928] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11929] &quot;Elinor could sit it no longer.  She almost ran out of the room, and as&quot;      
## [11930] &quot;soon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first&quot;        
## [11931] &quot;she thought would never cease.  Edward, who had till then looked any&quot;        
## [11932] &quot;where, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw--or even&quot;     
## [11933] &quot;heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie,&quot;      
## [11934] &quot;which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of Mrs.&quot;             
## [11935] &quot;Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word, quitted&quot;       
## [11936] &quot;the room, and walked out towards the village--leaving the others in the&quot;     
## [11937] &quot;greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation, so&quot;       
## [11938] &quot;wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity which they had no means of&quot;           
## [11939] &quot;lessening but by their own conjectures.&quot;                                     
## [11940] &quot;&quot;

## [11943] &quot;CHAPTER 49&quot;

## [11946] &quot;Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his release might&quot;           
## [11947] &quot;appear to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was free; and to&quot;     
## [11948] &quot;what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre-determined&quot;       
## [11949] &quot;by all;--for after experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent&quot;              
## [11950] &quot;engagement, contracted without his mother&#39;s consent, as he had already&quot;      
## [11951] &quot;done for more than four years, nothing less could be expected of him in&quot;     
## [11952] &quot;the failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction of another.&quot;             
## [11953] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11954] &quot;His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one.  It was only to ask&quot;        
## [11955] &quot;Elinor to marry him;--and considering that he was not altogether&quot;            
## [11956] &quot;inexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should&quot;        
## [11957] &quot;feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in&quot;      
## [11958] &quot;need of encouragement and fresh air.&quot;                                        
## [11959] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11960] &quot;How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however, how&quot;     
## [11961] &quot;soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he&quot;            
## [11962] &quot;expressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularly&quot;        
## [11963] &quot;told.  This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to table at&quot;     
## [11964] &quot;four o&#39;clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his&quot;       
## [11965] &quot;lady, engaged her mother&#39;s consent, and was not only in the rapturous&quot;       
## [11966] &quot;profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one&quot;       
## [11967] &quot;of the happiest of men.  His situation indeed was more than commonly&quot;        
## [11968] &quot;joyful.  He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to&quot;          
## [11969] &quot;swell his heart, and raise his spirits.  He was released without any&quot;        
## [11970] &quot;reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his&quot;         
## [11971] &quot;misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;--and elevated at&quot;      
## [11972] &quot;once to that security with another, which he must have thought of&quot;           
## [11973] &quot;almost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with&quot;           
## [11974] &quot;desire.  He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to&quot;     
## [11975] &quot;happiness;--and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine,&quot;             
## [11976] &quot;flowing, grateful cheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in&quot;       
## [11977] &quot;him before.&quot;                                                                 
## [11978] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11979] &quot;His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors&quot;        
## [11980] &quot;confessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the&quot;     
## [11981] &quot;philosophic dignity of twenty-four.&quot;                                         
## [11982] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [11983] &quot;\&quot;It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,\&quot; said he, \&quot;the&quot;           
## [11984] &quot;consequence of ignorance of the world--and want of employment.  Had my&quot;      
## [11985] &quot;mother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen&quot;       
## [11986] &quot;from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think--nay, I am sure, it would never&quot;         
## [11987] &quot;have happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the&quot;     
## [11988] &quot;time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had&quot;     
## [11989] &quot;any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance&quot;         
## [11990] &quot;from her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied&quot;     
## [11991] &quot;attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I&quot;     
## [11992] &quot;must have done.  But instead of having any thing to do, instead of&quot;          
## [11993] &quot;having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any&quot;          
## [11994] &quot;myself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first&quot;            
## [11995] &quot;twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which&quot;         
## [11996] &quot;belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not entered&quot;      
## [11997] &quot;at Oxford till I was nineteen.  I had therefore nothing in the world to&quot;     
## [11998] &quot;do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home&quot;      
## [11999] &quot;in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my&quot;        
## [12000] &quot;brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to&quot;      
## [12001] &quot;be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and&quot;        
## [12002] &quot;was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part&quot;     
## [12003] &quot;of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything&quot;        
## [12004] &quot;that was amiable and obliging.  She was pretty too--at least I thought&quot;      
## [12005] &quot;so THEN; and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make no&quot;      
## [12006] &quot;comparisons, and see no defects.  Considering everything, therefore, I&quot;      
## [12007] &quot;hope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since in every&quot;       
## [12008] &quot;way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable&quot;      
## [12009] &quot;piece of folly.\&quot;&quot;                                                           
## [12010] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12011] &quot;The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness&quot;     
## [12012] &quot;of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as promised them all, the&quot;             
## [12013] &quot;satisfaction of a sleepless night.  Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be&quot;          
## [12014] &quot;comfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how&quot;     
## [12015] &quot;to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy,&quot;        
## [12016] &quot;nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation&quot;          
## [12017] &quot;together, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and society of both.&quot;      
## [12018] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12019] &quot;Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears.  Comparisons would&quot;        
## [12020] &quot;occur--regrets would arise;--and her joy, though sincere as her love&quot;        
## [12021] &quot;for her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language.&quot;     
## [12022] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12023] &quot;But Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of&quot;       
## [12024] &quot;learning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to the&quot;     
## [12025] &quot;moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed, she&quot;     
## [12026] &quot;was every thing by turns but tranquil.  But when the second moment had&quot;      
## [12027] &quot;passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude removed, compared&quot;      
## [12028] &quot;her situation with what so lately it had been,--saw him honourably&quot;          
## [12029] &quot;released from his former engagement, saw him instantly profiting by the&quot;     
## [12030] &quot;release, to address herself and declare an affection as tender, as&quot;          
## [12031] &quot;constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she was oppressed, she was&quot;     
## [12032] &quot;overcome by her own felicity;--and happily disposed as is the human&quot;         
## [12033] &quot;mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better, it&quot;           
## [12034] &quot;required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any degree&quot;     
## [12035] &quot;of tranquillity to her heart.&quot;                                               
## [12036] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12037] &quot;Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever&quot;      
## [12038] &quot;other claims might be made on him, it was impossible that less than a&quot;       
## [12039] &quot;week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor&#39;s company, or&quot;            
## [12040] &quot;suffice to say half that was to be said of the past, the present, and&quot;       
## [12041] &quot;the future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of&quot;         
## [12042] &quot;incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in&quot;         
## [12043] &quot;common between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is&quot;            
## [12044] &quot;different.  Between THEM no subject is finished, no communication is&quot;        
## [12045] &quot;even made, till it has been made at least twenty times over.&quot;                
## [12046] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12047] &quot;Lucy&#39;s marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all,&quot;        
## [12048] &quot;formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and&quot;        
## [12049] &quot;Elinor&#39;s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in&quot;        
## [12050] &quot;every view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable&quot;              
## [12051] &quot;circumstances she had ever heard.  How they could be thrown together,&quot;       
## [12052] &quot;and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of&quot;         
## [12053] &quot;whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,--a&quot;     
## [12054] &quot;girl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose account that&quot;          
## [12055] &quot;brother had been thrown off by his family--it was beyond her&quot;                
## [12056] &quot;comprehension to make out.  To her own heart it was a delightful&quot;            
## [12057] &quot;affair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her&quot;         
## [12058] &quot;reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.&quot;                           
## [12059] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12060] &quot;Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps,&quot;       
## [12061] &quot;at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so worked&quot;     
## [12062] &quot;on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.&quot;     
## [12063] &quot;Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street, of his&quot;         
## [12064] &quot;opinion of what his own mediation in his brother&#39;s affairs might have&quot;       
## [12065] &quot;done, if applied to in time.  She repeated it to Edward.&quot;                    
## [12066] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12067] &quot;\&quot;THAT was exactly like Robert,\&quot;--was his immediate observation.--\&quot;And&quot;    
## [12068] &quot;THAT,\&quot; he presently added, \&quot;might perhaps be in HIS head when the&quot;         
## [12069] &quot;acquaintance between them first began.  And Lucy perhaps at first might&quot;     
## [12070] &quot;think only of procuring his good offices in my favour.  Other designs&quot;       
## [12071] &quot;might afterward arise.\&quot;&quot;                                                    
## [12072] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12073] &quot;How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally&quot;      
## [12074] &quot;at a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had&quot;             
## [12075] &quot;remained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no means&quot;     
## [12076] &quot;of hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very last&quot;        
## [12077] &quot;were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual.  Not the&quot;      
## [12078] &quot;smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him for&quot;         
## [12079] &quot;what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy&quot;      
## [12080] &quot;herself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified between&quot;     
## [12081] &quot;the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance.  He put the&quot;      
## [12082] &quot;letter into Elinor&#39;s hands.&quot;                                                 
## [12083] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12084] &quot;     \&quot;DEAR SIR,&quot;                                                            
## [12085] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12086] &quot;     \&quot;Being very sure I have long lost your affections,&quot;                    
## [12087] &quot;     I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own&quot;                      
## [12088] &quot;     on another, and have no doubt of being as happy with&quot;                   
## [12089] &quot;     him as I once used to think I might be with you;&quot;                       
## [12090] &quot;     but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was&quot;                       
## [12091] &quot;     another&#39;s.  Sincerely wish you happy in your choice,&quot;                   
## [12092] &quot;     and it shall not be my fault if we are not always&quot;                      
## [12093] &quot;     good friends, as our near relationship now makes&quot;                       
## [12094] &quot;     proper.  I can safely say I owe you no ill-will,&quot;                       
## [12095] &quot;     and am sure you will be too generous to do us any&quot;                      
## [12096] &quot;     ill offices.  Your brother has gained my affections&quot;                    
## [12097] &quot;     entirely, and as we could not live without one&quot;                         
## [12098] &quot;     another, we are just returned from the altar, and&quot;                      
## [12099] &quot;     are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks, which&quot;                   
## [12100] &quot;     place your dear brother has great curiosity to see,&quot;                    
## [12101] &quot;     but thought I would first trouble you with these&quot;

## [12110] &quot;     welcome to keep.\&quot;&quot;

## [12114] &quot;\&quot;I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,\&quot; said&quot;                
## [12115] &quot;Edward.--\&quot;For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU&quot;     
## [12116] &quot;in former days.--In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife!--how I&quot;        
## [12117] &quot;have blushed over the pages of her writing!--and I believe I may say&quot;        
## [12118] &quot;that since the first half year of our foolish--business--this is the&quot;        
## [12119] &quot;only letter I ever received from her, of which the substance made me&quot;        
## [12120] &quot;any amends for the defect of the style.\&quot;&quot;                                   
## [12121] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12122] &quot;\&quot;However it may have come about,\&quot; said Elinor, after a pause,--\&quot;they&quot;     
## [12123] &quot;are certainly married.  And your mother has brought on herself a most&quot;       
## [12124] &quot;appropriate punishment.  The independence she settled on Robert,&quot;            
## [12125] &quot;through resentment against you, has put it in his power to make his own&quot;     
## [12126] &quot;choice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand&quot;           
## [12127] &quot;a-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for&quot;            
## [12128] &quot;intending to do.  She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert&#39;s&quot;      
## [12129] &quot;marrying Lucy, than she would have been by your marrying her.\&quot;&quot;             
## [12130] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12131] &quot;\&quot;She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite.--She&quot;    
## [12132] &quot;will be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him&quot;         
## [12133] &quot;much sooner.\&quot;&quot;                                                              
## [12134] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12135] &quot;In what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew&quot;         
## [12136] &quot;not, for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted&quot;     
## [12137] &quot;by him.  He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after&quot;           
## [12138] &quot;Lucy&#39;s letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the nearest&quot;     
## [12139] &quot;road to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct, with&quot;      
## [12140] &quot;which that road did not hold the most intimate connection.  He could do&quot;     
## [12141] &quot;nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood; and by his&quot;     
## [12142] &quot;rapidity in seeking THAT fate, it is to be supposed, in spite of the&quot;        
## [12143] &quot;jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite of&quot;     
## [12144] &quot;the modesty with which he rated his own deserts, and the politeness&quot;         
## [12145] &quot;with which he talked of his doubts, he did not, upon the whole, expect&quot;      
## [12146] &quot;a very cruel reception.  It was his business, however, to say that he&quot;       
## [12147] &quot;DID, and he said it very prettily.  What he might say on the subject a&quot;      
## [12148] &quot;twelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination of husbands and&quot;      
## [12149] &quot;wives.&quot;                                                                      
## [12150] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12151] &quot;That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of&quot;      
## [12152] &quot;malice against him in her message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to&quot;         
## [12153] &quot;Elinor; and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on her&quot;               
## [12154] &quot;character, had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost&quot;            
## [12155] &quot;meanness of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long opened,&quot;        
## [12156] &quot;even before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her ignorance and a&quot;      
## [12157] &quot;want of liberality in some of her opinions--they had been equally&quot;           
## [12158] &quot;imputed, by him, to her want of education; and till her last letter&quot;         
## [12159] &quot;reached him, he had always believed her to be a well-disposed,&quot;              
## [12160] &quot;good-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself.  Nothing but&quot;         
## [12161] &quot;such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an&quot;             
## [12162] &quot;engagement, which, long before the discovery of it laid him open to his&quot;     
## [12163] &quot;mother&#39;s anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to&quot;       
## [12164] &quot;him.&quot;                                                                        
## [12165] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12166] &quot;\&quot;I thought it my duty,\&quot; said he, \&quot;independent of my feelings, to give&quot;    
## [12167] &quot;her the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was&quot;              
## [12168] &quot;renounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend in&quot;     
## [12169] &quot;the world to assist me.  In such a situation as that, where there&quot;           
## [12170] &quot;seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living&quot;             
## [12171] &quot;creature, how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly&quot;             
## [12172] &quot;insisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but&quot;       
## [12173] &quot;the most disinterested affection was her inducement?  And even now, I&quot;       
## [12174] &quot;cannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage&quot;       
## [12175] &quot;it could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the&quot;        
## [12176] &quot;smallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.&quot;         
## [12177] &quot;She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living.\&quot;&quot;        
## [12178] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12179] &quot;\&quot;No; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour;&quot;      
## [12180] &quot;that your own family might in time relent.  And at any rate, she lost&quot;       
## [12181] &quot;nothing by continuing the engagement, for she has proved that it&quot;            
## [12182] &quot;fettered neither her inclination nor her actions.  The connection was&quot;       
## [12183] &quot;certainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration&quot;          
## [12184] &quot;among her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it would&quot;     
## [12185] &quot;be better for her to marry YOU than be single.\&quot;&quot;                            
## [12186] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12187] &quot;Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have&quot;        
## [12188] &quot;been more natural than Lucy&#39;s conduct, nor more self-evident than the&quot;       
## [12189] &quot;motive of it.&quot;                                                               
## [12190] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12191] &quot;Elinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which&quot;     
## [12192] &quot;compliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them at&quot;          
## [12193] &quot;Norland, when he must have felt his own inconstancy.&quot;                        
## [12194] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12195] &quot;\&quot;Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,\&quot; said she; \&quot;because--to say&quot;    
## [12196] &quot;nothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to&quot;      
## [12197] &quot;fancy and expect WHAT, as you were THEN situated, could never be.\&quot;&quot;         
## [12198] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12199] &quot;He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart, and a mistaken&quot;           
## [12200] &quot;confidence in the force of his engagement.&quot;                                  
## [12201] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12202] &quot;\&quot;I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH was plighted to&quot;       
## [12203] &quot;another, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the&quot;        
## [12204] &quot;consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred&quot;      
## [12205] &quot;as my honour.  I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was only&quot;     
## [12206] &quot;friendship; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and&quot;       
## [12207] &quot;Lucy, I did not know how far I was got.  After that, I suppose, I WAS&quot;       
## [12208] &quot;wrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which I&quot;        
## [12209] &quot;reconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than&quot;              
## [12210] &quot;these:--The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but&quot;           
## [12211] &quot;myself.\&quot;&quot;                                                                   
## [12212] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12213] &quot;Elinor smiled, and shook her head.&quot;                                          
## [12214] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12215] &quot;Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon&#39;s being expected at the&quot;       
## [12216] &quot;Cottage, as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him,&quot;     
## [12217] &quot;but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented&quot;     
## [12218] &quot;his giving him the living of Delaford--\&quot;Which, at present,\&quot; said he,&quot;      
## [12219] &quot;\&quot;after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion,&quot;      
## [12220] &quot;he must think I have never forgiven him for offering.\&quot;&quot;                     
## [12221] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12222] &quot;NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place.&quot;     
## [12223] &quot;But so little interest had he taken in the matter, that he owed all his&quot;     
## [12224] &quot;knowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the parish,&quot;            
## [12225] &quot;condition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself, who&quot;       
## [12226] &quot;had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard it with so much&quot;     
## [12227] &quot;attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.&quot;                       
## [12228] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12229] &quot;One question after this only remained undecided, between them, one&quot;          
## [12230] &quot;difficulty only was to be overcome.  They were brought together by&quot;          
## [12231] &quot;mutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends;&quot;       
## [12232] &quot;their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness&quot;       
## [12233] &quot;certain--and they only wanted something to live upon.  Edward had two&quot;       
## [12234] &quot;thousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all&quot;       
## [12235] &quot;that they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs.&quot;             
## [12236] &quot;Dashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite&quot;       
## [12237] &quot;enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year&quot;          
## [12238] &quot;would supply them with the comforts of life.&quot;                                
## [12239] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12240] &quot;Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his&quot;      
## [12241] &quot;mother towards him; and on THAT he rested for the residue of their&quot;          
## [12242] &quot;income.  But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would&quot;          
## [12243] &quot;still be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself had been&quot;      
## [12244] &quot;spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s flattering language as only a lesser evil&quot;       
## [12245] &quot;than his chusing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert&#39;s offence would&quot;        
## [12246] &quot;serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.&quot;                                
## [12247] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12248] &quot;About four days after Edward&#39;s arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to&quot;         
## [12249] &quot;complete Mrs. Dashwood&#39;s satisfaction, and to give her the dignity of&quot;       
## [12250] &quot;having, for the first time since her living at Barton, more company&quot;         
## [12251] &quot;with her than her house would hold.  Edward was allowed to retain the&quot;       
## [12252] &quot;privilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every&quot;        
## [12253] &quot;night to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returned&quot;      
## [12254] &quot;in the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers&#39; first tete-a-tete&quot;     
## [12255] &quot;before breakfast.&quot;                                                           
## [12256] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12257] &quot;A three weeks&#39; residence at Delaford, where, in his evening hours at&quot;        
## [12258] &quot;least, he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between&quot;       
## [12259] &quot;thirty-six and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind&quot;         
## [12260] &quot;which needed all the improvement in Marianne&#39;s looks, all the kindness&quot;      
## [12261] &quot;of her welcome, and all the encouragement of her mother&#39;s language, to&quot;      
## [12262] &quot;make it cheerful.  Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he&quot;       
## [12263] &quot;did revive.  No rumour of Lucy&#39;s marriage had yet reached him:--he knew&quot;     
## [12264] &quot;nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were&quot;           
## [12265] &quot;consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.  Every thing was&quot;            
## [12266] &quot;explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to rejoice&quot;     
## [12267] &quot;in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the&quot;       
## [12268] &quot;interest of Elinor.&quot;                                                         
## [12269] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12270] &quot;It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the good&quot;        
## [12271] &quot;opinion of each other, as they advanced in each other&#39;s acquaintance,&quot;       
## [12272] &quot;for it could not be otherwise.  Their resemblance in good principles&quot;        
## [12273] &quot;and good sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably&quot;       
## [12274] &quot;have been sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any other&quot;         
## [12275] &quot;attraction; but their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters&quot;       
## [12276] &quot;fond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,&quot;       
## [12277] &quot;which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment.&quot;          
## [12278] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12279] &quot;The letters from town, which a few days before would have made every&quot;        
## [12280] &quot;nerve in Elinor&#39;s body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read&quot;        
## [12281] &quot;with less emotion than mirth.  Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the&quot;              
## [12282] &quot;wonderful tale, to vent her honest indignation against the jilting&quot;          
## [12283] &quot;girl, and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she&quot;       
## [12284] &quot;was sure, had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by all&quot;     
## [12285] &quot;accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.-- \&quot;I do think,\&quot; she&quot;           
## [12286] &quot;continued, \&quot;nothing was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two days&quot;    
## [12287] &quot;before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me.  Not a soul&quot;           
## [12288] &quot;suspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!  came&quot;     
## [12289] &quot;crying to me the day after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars,&quot;     
## [12290] &quot;as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems&quot;            
## [12291] &quot;borrowed all her money before she went off to be married, on purpose we&quot;     
## [12292] &quot;suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in&quot;      
## [12293] &quot;the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her&quot;         
## [12294] &quot;down to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with&quot;        
## [12295] &quot;Mrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor&quot;           
## [12296] &quot;again.  And I must say that Lucy&#39;s crossness not to take them along&quot;         
## [12297] &quot;with them in the chaise is worse than all.  Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot&quot;       
## [12298] &quot;get him out of my head, but you must send for him to Barton, and Miss&quot;       
## [12299] &quot;Marianne must try to comfort him.\&quot;&quot;                                         
## [12300] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12301] &quot;Mr. Dashwood&#39;s strains were more solemn.  Mrs. Ferrars was the most&quot;         
## [12302] &quot;unfortunate of women--poor Fanny had suffered agonies of&quot;                    
## [12303] &quot;sensibility--and he considered the existence of each, under such a&quot;          
## [12304] &quot;blow, with grateful wonder.  Robert&#39;s offence was unpardonable, but&quot;         
## [12305] &quot;Lucy&#39;s was infinitely worse.  Neither of them were ever again to be&quot;         
## [12306] &quot;mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even, if she might hereafter be induced&quot;      
## [12307] &quot;to forgive her son, his wife should never be acknowledged as her&quot;            
## [12308] &quot;daughter, nor be permitted to appear in her presence.  The secrecy with&quot;     
## [12309] &quot;which everything had been carried on between them, was rationally&quot;           
## [12310] &quot;treated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any suspicion&quot;     
## [12311] &quot;of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have been taken to&quot;      
## [12312] &quot;prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join with him in&quot;           
## [12313] &quot;regretting that Lucy&#39;s engagement with Edward had not rather been&quot;           
## [12314] &quot;fulfilled, than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery&quot;       
## [12315] &quot;farther in the family.-- He thus continued:&quot;                                 
## [12316] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12317] &quot;\&quot;Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward&#39;s name, which does not&quot;        
## [12318] &quot;surprise us; but, to our great astonishment, not a line has been&quot;            
## [12319] &quot;received from him on the occasion.  Perhaps, however, he is kept silent&quot;     
## [12320] &quot;by his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a&quot;     
## [12321] &quot;line to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper&quot;         
## [12322] &quot;submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shewn to&quot;        
## [12323] &quot;her mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness of&quot;     
## [12324] &quot;Mrs. Ferrars&#39;s heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be&quot;      
## [12325] &quot;on good terms with her children.\&quot;&quot;                                          
## [12326] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12327] &quot;This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of&quot;       
## [12328] &quot;Edward.  It determined him to attempt a reconciliation, though not&quot;          
## [12329] &quot;exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.&quot;              
## [12330] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12331] &quot;\&quot;A letter of proper submission!\&quot; repeated he; \&quot;would they have me beg&quot;    
## [12332] &quot;my mother&#39;s pardon for Robert&#39;s ingratitude to HER, and breach of&quot;           
## [12333] &quot;honour to ME?--I can make no submission--I am grown neither humble nor&quot;      
## [12334] &quot;penitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy; but that would not&quot;     
## [12335] &quot;interest.--I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make.\&quot;&quot;         
## [12336] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12337] &quot;\&quot;You may certainly ask to be forgiven,\&quot; said Elinor, \&quot;because you have&quot;   
## [12338] &quot;offended;--and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to&quot;            
## [12339] &quot;profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew&quot;       
## [12340] &quot;on you your mother&#39;s anger.\&quot;&quot;                                               
## [12341] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12342] &quot;He agreed that he might.&quot;                                                    
## [12343] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12344] &quot;\&quot;And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be&quot;           
## [12345] &quot;convenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as imprudent&quot;     
## [12346] &quot;in HER eyes as the first.\&quot;&quot;                                                 
## [12347] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12348] &quot;He had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a&quot;         
## [12349] &quot;letter of proper submission; and therefore, to make it easier to him,&quot;       
## [12350] &quot;as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by&quot;       
## [12351] &quot;word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that, instead of writing&quot;       
## [12352] &quot;to Fanny, he should go to London, and personally intreat her good&quot;           
## [12353] &quot;offices in his favour.-- \&quot;And if they really DO interest themselves,\&quot;&quot;     
## [12354] &quot;said Marianne, in her new character of candour, \&quot;in bringing about a&quot;       
## [12355] &quot;reconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely&quot;     
## [12356] &quot;without merit.\&quot;&quot;                                                            
## [12357] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12358] &quot;After a visit on Colonel Brandon&#39;s side of only three or four days, the&quot;     
## [12359] &quot;two gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately to&quot;     
## [12360] &quot;Delaford, that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future&quot;      
## [12361] &quot;home, and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements&quot;     
## [12362] &quot;were needed to it; and from thence, after staying there a couple of&quot;         
## [12363] &quot;nights, he was to proceed on his journey to town.&quot;                           
## [12364] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12365] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12366] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12367] &quot;CHAPTER 50&quot;                                                                  
## [12368] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12369] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12370] &quot;After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violent&quot;      
## [12371] &quot;and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always&quot;        
## [12372] &quot;seemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edward&quot;      
## [12373] &quot;was admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.&quot;           
## [12374] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12375] &quot;Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.  For many years of&quot;     
## [12376] &quot;her life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of Edward&quot;     
## [12377] &quot;a few weeks ago, had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of&quot;         
## [12378] &quot;Robert had left her for a fortnight without any; and now, by the&quot;            
## [12379] &quot;resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.&quot;                                 
## [12380] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12381] &quot;In spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not&quot;        
## [12382] &quot;feel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his&quot;      
## [12383] &quot;present engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he&quot;            
## [12384] &quot;feared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him off&quot;     
## [12385] &quot;as rapidly as before.  With apprehensive caution therefore it was&quot;           
## [12386] &quot;revealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness.  Mrs.&quot;            
## [12387] &quot;Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying&quot;       
## [12388] &quot;Miss Dashwood, by every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss&quot;      
## [12389] &quot;Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--and&quot;        
## [12390] &quot;enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter&quot;      
## [12391] &quot;of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only&quot;     
## [12392] &quot;the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE; but when&quot;       
## [12393] &quot;she found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her&quot;                 
## [12394] &quot;representation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she&quot;         
## [12395] &quot;judged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit--and&quot;           
## [12396] &quot;therefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own&quot;            
## [12397] &quot;dignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she&quot;         
## [12398] &quot;issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.&quot;          
## [12399] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12400] &quot;What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to&quot;     
## [12401] &quot;be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now&quot;     
## [12402] &quot;her only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was&quot;           
## [12403] &quot;inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest&quot;          
## [12404] &quot;objection was made against Edward&#39;s taking orders for the sake of two&quot;       
## [12405] &quot;hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for&quot;       
## [12406] &quot;the present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had&quot;         
## [12407] &quot;been given with Fanny.&quot;                                                      
## [12408] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12409] &quot;It was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, by&quot;     
## [12410] &quot;Edward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,&quot;      
## [12411] &quot;seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.&quot;                    
## [12412] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12413] &quot;With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,&quot;        
## [12414] &quot;they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the&quot;          
## [12415] &quot;living, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with&quot;      
## [12416] &quot;an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making&quot;                 
## [12417] &quot;considerable improvements; and after waiting some time for their&quot;            
## [12418] &quot;completion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments&quot;        
## [12419] &quot;and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,&quot;      
## [12420] &quot;as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying&quot;       
## [12421] &quot;till every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton&quot;           
## [12422] &quot;church early in the autumn.&quot;                                                 
## [12423] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12424] &quot;The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the&quot;     
## [12425] &quot;Mansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the&quot;       
## [12426] &quot;Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--could&quot;         
## [12427] &quot;chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.  Mrs. Jennings&#39;s&quot;     
## [12428] &quot;prophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; for&quot;     
## [12429] &quot;she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by&quot;             
## [12430] &quot;Michaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her husband, as she really&quot;          
## [12431] &quot;believed, one of the happiest couples in the world.  They had in fact&quot;       
## [12432] &quot;nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne,&quot;      
## [12433] &quot;and rather better pasturage for their cows.&quot;                                 
## [12434] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12435] &quot;They were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations&quot;     
## [12436] &quot;and friends.  Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was&quot;      
## [12437] &quot;almost ashamed of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at the&quot;     
## [12438] &quot;expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.&quot;                         
## [12439] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12440] &quot;\&quot;I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,\&quot; said John, as&quot;    
## [12441] &quot;they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford&quot;         
## [12442] &quot;House, \&quot;THAT would be saying too much, for certainly you have been one&quot;     
## [12443] &quot;of the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is.  But, I&quot;           
## [12444] &quot;confess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon&quot;            
## [12445] &quot;brother.  His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in&quot;        
## [12446] &quot;such respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I have not&quot;       
## [12447] &quot;seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in&quot;      
## [12448] &quot;Delaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly&quot;        
## [12449] &quot;the person to attract him--yet I think it would altogether be advisable&quot;     
## [12450] &quot;for you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel&quot;        
## [12451] &quot;Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may&quot;                
## [12452] &quot;happen--for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of&quot;        
## [12453] &quot;anybody else--and it will always be in your power to set her off to&quot;         
## [12454] &quot;advantage, and so forth;--in short, you may as well give her a&quot;              
## [12455] &quot;chance--You understand me.\&quot;--&quot;                                              
## [12456] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12457] &quot;But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always treated them&quot;       
## [12458] &quot;with the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by&quot;      
## [12459] &quot;her real favour and preference.  THAT was due to the folly of Robert,&quot;       
## [12460] &quot;and the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before many&quot;          
## [12461] &quot;months had passed away.  The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had&quot;      
## [12462] &quot;at first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of&quot;      
## [12463] &quot;his deliverance from it; for her respectful humility, assiduous&quot;             
## [12464] &quot;attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was&quot;     
## [12465] &quot;given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, and&quot;        
## [12466] &quot;re-established him completely in her favour.&quot;                                
## [12467] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12468] &quot;The whole of Lucy&#39;s behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which&quot;       
## [12469] &quot;crowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance&quot;     
## [12470] &quot;of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however&quot;        
## [12471] &quot;its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every&quot;        
## [12472] &quot;advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and&quot;         
## [12473] &quot;conscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privately&quot;       
## [12474] &quot;visited her in Bartlett&#39;s Buildings, it was only with the view imputed&quot;      
## [12475] &quot;to him by his brother.  He merely meant to persuade her to give up the&quot;      
## [12476] &quot;engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection&quot;     
## [12477] &quot;of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle&quot;      
## [12478] &quot;the matter.  In that point, however, and that only, he erred;--for&quot;          
## [12479] &quot;though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her&quot;       
## [12480] &quot;in TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to&quot;          
## [12481] &quot;produce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered in her mind when&quot;      
## [12482] &quot;they parted, which could only be removed by another half hour&#39;s&quot;             
## [12483] &quot;discourse with himself.  His attendance was by this means secured, and&quot;      
## [12484] &quot;the rest followed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward, they came&quot;       
## [12485] &quot;gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had always&quot;         
## [12486] &quot;more to say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed an&quot;            
## [12487] &quot;interest even equal to his own; and in short, it became speedily&quot;            
## [12488] &quot;evident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.  He was&quot;       
## [12489] &quot;proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of&quot;          
## [12490] &quot;marrying privately without his mother&#39;s consent.  What immediately&quot;          
## [12491] &quot;followed is known.  They passed some months in great happiness at&quot;           
## [12492] &quot;Dawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut--and&quot;       
## [12493] &quot;he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--and from thence&quot;            
## [12494] &quot;returning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the&quot;         
## [12495] &quot;simple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy&#39;s instigation, was&quot;            
## [12496] &quot;adopted.  The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable,&quot;             
## [12497] &quot;comprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and&quot;     
## [12498] &quot;therefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks&quot;           
## [12499] &quot;longer unpardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct and&quot;             
## [12500] &quot;messages, in self-condemnation for Robert&#39;s offence, and gratitude for&quot;      
## [12501] &quot;the unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty&quot;       
## [12502] &quot;notice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards,&quot;     
## [12503] &quot;by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.&quot;          
## [12504] &quot;Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny;&quot;        
## [12505] &quot;and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended&quot;      
## [12506] &quot;to marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in fortune and birth,&quot;      
## [12507] &quot;was spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, and&quot;        
## [12508] &quot;always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.  They settled in&quot;       
## [12509] &quot;town, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the&quot;       
## [12510] &quot;best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the&quot;             
## [12511] &quot;jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,&quot;      
## [12512] &quot;in which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent&quot;      
## [12513] &quot;domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing&quot;          
## [12514] &quot;could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together.&quot;                  
## [12515] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12516] &quot;What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have&quot;         
## [12517] &quot;puzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to&quot;     
## [12518] &quot;it, might have puzzled them still more.  It was an arrangement,&quot;             
## [12519] &quot;however, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing&quot;         
## [12520] &quot;ever appeared in Robert&#39;s style of living or of talking to give a&quot;           
## [12521] &quot;suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either leaving&quot;     
## [12522] &quot;his brother too little, or bringing himself too much;--and if Edward&quot;        
## [12523] &quot;might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every&quot;             
## [12524] &quot;particular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, and&quot;     
## [12525] &quot;from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no&quot;       
## [12526] &quot;less contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an&quot;             
## [12527] &quot;exchange.&quot;                                                                   
## [12528] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12529] &quot;Elinor&#39;s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well&quot;       
## [12530] &quot;be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless,&quot;     
## [12531] &quot;for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with&quot;        
## [12532] &quot;her.  Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure&quot;     
## [12533] &quot;in the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringing&quot;        
## [12534] &quot;Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though&quot;       
## [12535] &quot;rather more liberal than what John had expressed.  It was now her&quot;           
## [12536] &quot;darling object.  Precious as was the company of her daughter to her,&quot;        
## [12537] &quot;she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her&quot;     
## [12538] &quot;valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was&quot;         
## [12539] &quot;equally the wish of Edward and Elinor.  They each felt his sorrows, and&quot;     
## [12540] &quot;their own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the&quot;      
## [12541] &quot;reward of all.&quot;                                                              
## [12542] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12543] &quot;With such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge so intimate of&quot;        
## [12544] &quot;his goodness--with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself,&quot;          
## [12545] &quot;which at last, though long after it was observable to everybody&quot;             
## [12546] &quot;else--burst on her--what could she do?&quot;                                      
## [12547] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12548] &quot;Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate.  She was born to&quot;       
## [12549] &quot;discover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her&quot;       
## [12550] &quot;conduct, her most favourite maxims.  She was born to overcome an&quot;            
## [12551] &quot;affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment&quot;     
## [12552] &quot;superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give&quot;        
## [12553] &quot;her hand to another!--and THAT other, a man who had suffered no less&quot;        
## [12554] &quot;than herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years&quot;        
## [12555] &quot;before, she had considered too old to be married,--and who still sought&quot;     
## [12556] &quot;the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!&quot;                        
## [12557] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12558] &quot;But so it was.  Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible&quot;           
## [12559] &quot;passion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,--instead&quot;  
## [12560] &quot;of remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her only&quot;            
## [12561] &quot;pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her more calm and&quot;       
## [12562] &quot;sober judgment she had determined on,--she found herself at nineteen,&quot;       
## [12563] &quot;submitting to new attachments, entering on new duties, placed in a new&quot;      
## [12564] &quot;home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.&quot;     
## [12565] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12566] &quot;Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,&quot;          
## [12567] &quot;believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every past&quot;     
## [12568] &quot;affliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to animation,&quot;     
## [12569] &quot;and his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own&quot;            
## [12570] &quot;happiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight of&quot;         
## [12571] &quot;each observing friend.  Marianne could never love by halves; and her&quot;        
## [12572] &quot;whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had&quot;      
## [12573] &quot;once been to Willoughby.&quot;                                                    
## [12574] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12575] &quot;Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his&quot;           
## [12576] &quot;punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of&quot;     
## [12577] &quot;Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as&quot;      
## [12578] &quot;the source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he&quot;       
## [12579] &quot;behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy&quot;      
## [12580] &quot;and rich.  That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its&quot;        
## [12581] &quot;own punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;--nor that he long&quot;         
## [12582] &quot;thought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.  But&quot;     
## [12583] &quot;that he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or&quot;            
## [12584] &quot;contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must&quot;     
## [12585] &quot;not be depended on--for he did neither.  He lived to exert, and&quot;             
## [12586] &quot;frequently to enjoy himself.  His wife was not always out of humour,&quot;        
## [12587] &quot;nor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,&quot;     
## [12588] &quot;and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree of&quot;         
## [12589] &quot;domestic felicity.&quot;                                                          
## [12590] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12591] &quot;For Marianne, however--in spite of his incivility in surviving her&quot;          
## [12592] &quot;loss--he always retained that decided regard which interested him in&quot;        
## [12593] &quot;every thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of&quot;            
## [12594] &quot;perfection in woman;--and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him&quot;     
## [12595] &quot;in after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.&quot;                   
## [12596] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12597] &quot;Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without&quot;          
## [12598] &quot;attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs.&quot;     
## [12599] &quot;Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an&quot;        
## [12600] &quot;age highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being&quot;          
## [12601] &quot;supposed to have a lover.&quot;                                                   
## [12602] &quot;&quot;                                                                            
## [12603] &quot;Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication&quot;          
## [12604] &quot;which strong family affection would naturally dictate;--and among the&quot;       
## [12605] &quot;merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked&quot;       
## [12606] &quot;as the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost&quot;           
## [12607] &quot;within sight of each other, they could live without disagreement&quot;            
## [12608] &quot;between themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.&quot;
